According the report, five staff members of the Sipadan resort, and a Filipino, a Malaysian policeman and four staffers of the Malaysian wildlife department, were also among the abducted.
SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Rescue teams were searching Southeast Asian seas on Tuesday for assailants who abducted 20 hostages from a Malaysian diving resort -- an attack that Philippine Muslim rebels claimed they carried out.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
Malaysia is very safe for tourists.''
