Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
