Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
Two committees have been formed by the public to investigate the Soeharto clan's wealth.
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
Meanwhile, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung Monday reiterated the government's seriousness in investigating Soeharto's wealth.
He said the special team tasked to investigate the former president has already scheduled a meeting with Soeharto.
The decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
