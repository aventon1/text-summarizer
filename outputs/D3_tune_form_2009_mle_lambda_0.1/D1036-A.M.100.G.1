(STORY CAN END HERE.
Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades.
The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
While dioxin poisoning is not medically unknown, it typically occurs through environmental exposure, when it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
