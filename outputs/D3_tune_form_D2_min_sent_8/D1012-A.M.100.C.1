A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials said.
How that did not happen (with the Helios flight) is extremely strange.''
