Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
He was arrested early Friday, a day after giving police a statement, "Tattoo" owner Marcus Wiggins said Friday.
"We have to wait for the investigation to finish," she said.
In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers _ less than a day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members started looking.
"This is a place of hospitality, not hostility," he said.
