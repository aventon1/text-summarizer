Blake is accused of murdering Bakley on May 4, 2001.
The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
Robert Blake's lawyer told jurors Thursday that they should discredit the testimony of two aging Hollywood stuntmen who say Blake asked them to kill his wife because they are drug addicts who have lied to authorities.
"It is an absolutely absurd scenario," he said.
Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
