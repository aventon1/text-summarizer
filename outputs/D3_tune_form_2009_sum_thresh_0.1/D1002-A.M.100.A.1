Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.
The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand  jury.
After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether the officers waive their right to a jury trial.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
Diallo was hit 19 times.
