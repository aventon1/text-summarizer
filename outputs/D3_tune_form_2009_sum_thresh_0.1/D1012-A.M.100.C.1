A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
Suspicions of a technical fault as the cause of the crash grew through the day as several of the callers said that they had experienced severe air conditioning problems when flying similar Helios jets in recent months.
The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials said.
It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
