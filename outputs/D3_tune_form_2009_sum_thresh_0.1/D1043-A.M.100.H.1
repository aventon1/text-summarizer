Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
The Lebanese interior minister said on Tuesday that initial indications showed that former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a suicide car bombing.
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
It said Hariri was targeted because "he was an agent" for Saudi Arabia.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.
The success of those winds will not come from the outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and women like Rafik Hariri.
