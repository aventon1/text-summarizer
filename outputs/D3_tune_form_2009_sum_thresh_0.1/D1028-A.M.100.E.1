Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
He also is charged with a third fatal bombing in New Jersey.
The UNABOMber was so named because his early targets were universities and airlines.
Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of 16 bombings, which killed two men and wounded two others.
Kaczynski, who was arrested in April last year, has pleaded innocent to all charges.
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
