Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products.
The list of recalled foods includes dressings used by McDonald's fast food chain, packets of potato chips and pre-prepared meals.
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
