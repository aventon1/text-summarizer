But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
While dioxin poisoning is not medically unknown, it typically occurs through environmental exposure, when it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
"I was deeply disappointed in this man," he told reporters.
