Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said he also supported taking bears off the list.
Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears now live in the region, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.
"It's probably one of the most studied mammals in the world," said Chuck Schwartz, head of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, in Bozeman, Mont., which has primary responsibility for studying the Yellowstone bear.
