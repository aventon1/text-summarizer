LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The sheriff's initial estimate of as  many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building counted some victims more than once.
Columbine is about three miles away.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves.
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School  students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
