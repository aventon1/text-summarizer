Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600 pounds.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Grizzly habitat is being threatened by development, and the bears' food sources also are at risk, she said.
``We know more about this population of grizzly bears than any population of grizzly bears anywhere,'' Manson said, adding the department will monitor the animals' health for five years after they come off the list.
