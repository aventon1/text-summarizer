Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located.
The Qinling panda has been identified as a sub-species of the giant panda that mainly resides in southwestern Sichuan province.
The panda was critically ill and had fallen into a coma when she was spotted Sunday morning by a passing driver beside a road six km from the famous Wolong giant panda research and conservation center, the paper said on Tuesday.
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
