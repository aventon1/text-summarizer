The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by listeria are reported in the United States each year.
An estimated  1,100 people in the United States become seriously ill each year from eating food contaminated with Listeria.
Products from the Bil Mar plant, for example, are distributed all over the United States.
In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
