Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
It's very scary,'' Bush said.
``We are going to feel it,'' he said.
``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said.
Instead, she just bought hurricane supplies.
``It's beautiful,'' said Penalver.
As if the threat of this hurricane was not enough bad news for Florida, another potentially dangerous storm, Hurricane Gert, seems to be taking roughly the same path as Floyd, just a few days behind.
For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
