Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
Diallo was hit 19 times.
