Identity theft accounts for about half of the $1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret Service, which monitors the crime.
Identity theft, one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it to apply for credit.
``Back in 1988 when it happened (to me), nobody even knew what I was talking about,'' said Elsie Strong of Los Angeles, founder of the support group Victims of Identity Theft.
``I'm a small business.''
The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 makes it a felony to commit identity theft.
