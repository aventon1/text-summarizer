Both the abnormal bodies and many of the symptoms are associated with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's, the institute points out, so scientists do not know whether the ailment is a distinct disease or a variant of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.
Like many degenerative brain diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, proteins targeted in the disease process begin misfolding and clumping in or around brain cells, which are called neurons.
But Dr. Steve Finkbeiner and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and the university's Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease have discovered that the mutant protein that clumps inside the brain cells of Huntington's patients actually saves cells from dying.
