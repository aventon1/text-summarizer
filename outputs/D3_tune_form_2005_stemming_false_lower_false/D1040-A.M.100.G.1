Robert Blake deserves to be convicted of killing his wife, and the actor's celebrity shouldn't gain him any special treatment, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday in closing arguments.
"The implication of counsel in opening argument is that Robert Blake is being prosecuted because he is Robert Blake and a regular John Doe wouldn't be prosecuted under the same circumstances," Samuels said.
Robert Blake's lawyer told jurors Thursday that they should discredit the testimony of two aging Hollywood stuntmen who say Blake asked them to kill his wife because they are drug addicts who have lied to authorities.
Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.
