Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
Scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens, which erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years with a minor explosion, said on Saturday that they were expecting a more powerful eruption within a day or so.
Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
"This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's Stephanie Hanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted.
"We're just watching," she said.
