The defense on Monday demanded that the judge be changed for the court martial of Private Lynndie England, the US soldier seen in photographs from Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison holding a leash attached to the neck of a naked inmate.
Lynndie England testified Monday as she pleaded guilty to seven abuse-related charges.
Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
England said she believed Graner took the pictures "for his own amusement."
