On November 28, the company shut down Snorre A after a gas leak was detected.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
The Petroleum Safety Directorate was created in January 2004 to oversee safety, health and environmental concerns on Norwegian offshore oil fields.
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
