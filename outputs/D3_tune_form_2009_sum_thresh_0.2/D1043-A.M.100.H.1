Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.
Hariri wan not perfect -- no human is.
The success of those winds will not come from the outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and women like Rafik Hariri.
Hariri, 60, died on Monday when his motorcade was blown up by a suicide car bomber in western Beirut seafront.
