New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture," he said.
It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese news reports said.
"We need to work together to promote conservation."
Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
