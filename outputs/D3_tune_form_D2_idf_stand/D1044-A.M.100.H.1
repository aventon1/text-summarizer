Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
China has already forbidden the use of Sudan I in foods, according to agency sources.
A total of 474 food products are now being recalled, amid fears they could contain traces of Sudan I _ a red dye used for coloring oils, waxes, petrol and shoe polish.
