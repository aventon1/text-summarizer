Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether the officers waive their right to a jury trial.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
