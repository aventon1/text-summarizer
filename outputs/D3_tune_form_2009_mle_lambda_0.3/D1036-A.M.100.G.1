But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades.
The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
