Sudan 1 is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in Britain and the whole EU region.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
"This has been an enormous undertaking.
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
