The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
An 80-kilometer chemical slick has been slowly moving downstream along the Songhua River and reached Harbin on Thursday morning.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
Zhang said as the polluted water flows downstream, the density of pollutants has markedly subsided.
