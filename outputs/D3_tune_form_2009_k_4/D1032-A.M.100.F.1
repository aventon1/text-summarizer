Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.

The Petroleum Safety Directorate was created in January 2004 to oversee safety, health and environmental concerns on Norwegian offshore oil fields.
