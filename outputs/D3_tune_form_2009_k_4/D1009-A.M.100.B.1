The Ramseys have denied any involvement.
The grand jury will begin hearing evidence later this month, Laurion said.
Romer also considered a Ramsey family friend's claim that Hunter's friendship with lawyers representing John and Patsy Ramsey clouded his judgment on the case.
The friend, Fleet White, criticized the Ramseys, saying their refusal to cooperate with detectives hurt the investigation of their daughter's death.
The Ramseys remain under suspicion in the homicide.
White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
The Ramseys have proclaimed their innocence.
