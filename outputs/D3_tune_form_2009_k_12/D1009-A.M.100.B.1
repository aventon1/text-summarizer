The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand jury.
The Ramseys have denied any involvement.
``The case is going to the grand jury,'' Jim Carpenter, the governor's spokesman, said on Thursday.
Romer also considered a Ramsey family friend's claim that Hunter's friendship with lawyers representing John and Patsy Ramsey clouded his judgment on the case.
White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
The Ramseys have proclaimed their innocence.
