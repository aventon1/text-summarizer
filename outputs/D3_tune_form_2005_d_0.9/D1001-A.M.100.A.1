The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves.
Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts from the popular students at Columbine.
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School  students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.
