The plane that went down was manufactured seven years ago and delivered to Helios in April 2004.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
"There is wreckage everywhere," Grammatiko Mayor George Papageorgiou said.
Crash scene investigators wearing surgical masks said most bodies appeared to be intact with some badly burnt.
