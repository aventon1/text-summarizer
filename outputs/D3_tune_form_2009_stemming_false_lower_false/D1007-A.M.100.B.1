Three more people remained hospitalized.
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
Of the nine confirmed cases, a three-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 54-year-old man have died.
Of the five other cases suspected of being infected of the H5N1 virus, four are under treatment in satisfactory condition and one, a 19-year-old girl, is in critical condition, the department said.
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
