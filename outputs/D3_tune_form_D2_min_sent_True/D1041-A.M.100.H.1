More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
The conservation union -- which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species -- also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
"With so many reefs endangered, efforts to save corals could be overlooked," Carl Gustaf Lundin, Head of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Marine Program was quoted by the press release as saying.
