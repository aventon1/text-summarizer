The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
"That's what this case is all about, the defendant getting what he wants," Samuels said.
Blake, 71, is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder.
Robert Blake starred in such films as "In Cold Blood" and in TV shows like "Baretta," but he couldn't pull off the role of a distraught husband, a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in the actor's murder trial.
``Jurors are more likely to identify with witnesses, not with the judge, lawyers or the defendant.''
