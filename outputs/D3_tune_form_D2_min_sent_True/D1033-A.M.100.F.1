President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun on Monday ordered the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to thoroughly investigate the allegation that one of the nation's biggest conglomerates provided huge slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case, his spokesman Kim Man-Soo said.
Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in the 1997 presidential election.
