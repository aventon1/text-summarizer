The severity of the global threat to thousands of species of frogs, salamanders and other amphibians makes them perhaps the most endangered class of animals on Earth, with their rapid decline outpacing that of mammals and birds.
About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
"They're (a) huge relative to our native frogs," said John Jensen, Georgia's state herpetologist with the Department of Natural Resources.
