Kaczynski has also pleaded innocent in the case.
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has rejected a motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of 16 bombings, which killed two men and wounded two others.
Kaczynski, who was arrested in April last year, has pleaded innocent to all charges.
Media reports said Kaczynski's lawyers requested the transfer, which was completed Wednesday, 10 weeks before his trial begins in Sacramento.
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
