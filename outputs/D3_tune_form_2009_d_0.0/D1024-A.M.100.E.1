The letter was from Sudan's foreign minister, Erwa said.
Sudan said it produced pharmaceutical products.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
In his four-page letter, Roric denied that bin Laden owns the pharmaceutical factory and described accusations that the factory produces chemical weapons as ``untrue,'' adding ``the United States government does not have evidence.''
The pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.
State-run Sudan television said the factory, which opened in 1996, produced about half of the country's medicines.
