he asked the prospective jurors.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney  brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs said.
Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did  not participate in Shepard's beating.
``Laramie's small enough that if you don't know the victim, you  at least know people who do,'' he said.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  convicted.
