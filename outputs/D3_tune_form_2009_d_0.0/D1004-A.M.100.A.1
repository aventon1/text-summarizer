PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said Sunday.
Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people were missing.
``There are still people out there who are injured that we have not rescued,'' he said.
At Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead.
The beaches are clean,'' Cassey said.
