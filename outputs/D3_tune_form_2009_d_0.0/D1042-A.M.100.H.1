Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
Prosecutors described Graner, who is said to be England's ex-boyfriend, as the ringleader of a group of Abu Ghraib guards who mistreated Iraqi detainees.
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
England said she believed Graner took the pictures "for his own amusement."
``I knew it was wrong,'' she said.
Of the eight soldiers charged over the Abu Ghraib scandal, only Graner's case has gone to trial.
``But I did what they wanted me to.''
