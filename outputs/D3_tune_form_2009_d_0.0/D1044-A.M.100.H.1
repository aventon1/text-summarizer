Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
