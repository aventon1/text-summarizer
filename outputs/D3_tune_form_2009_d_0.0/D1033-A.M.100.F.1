Samsung apologized Monday over the issue.
A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
Kim "never received any report of such illegal activities" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement.
Last month, television network MBC said it had acquired a spy agency recording of a 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group, the country's biggest industrial conglomerate.
