Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China.
It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951.
A national forest garden was established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area.
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
China's largest group of wild Indian elephants, as well as gaurus, peacocks, gibbons, and 105 other endangered species under protection, inhabit the primeval forest.
