Blake, 71, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Bakley.
"Those monsters will never get her," Blake said.
"When the solicitations were unsuccessful, he did it himself," Samuels said.
"It doesn't matter what you think of Bonny," Samuels said.
"End this nightmare for Mr. Blake," he said, "and you will give him back his life."
"It is an absolutely absurd scenario," he said.
Bakley, 44, was killed May 4, 2001, outside Blake's favorite Italian restaurant in Studio City.
Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
