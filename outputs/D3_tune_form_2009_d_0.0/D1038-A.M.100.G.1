The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the volcano, which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980, was shaken by a "tremor burst" for 25 minutes.
"All this suggests that a second eruption is imminent," said USGS spokeswoman Catherine Puckett.
"This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's Stephanie Hanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted.
On May 18, 1980, after weeks of quakes, slides and tremors, of belching smoke, steam and ash, Mount St. Helens, a major peak in the Cascade mountain chain, erupted.
"We had to come back here when this happened," she said.
"The larger earthquakes have dropped off," Qamar said.
