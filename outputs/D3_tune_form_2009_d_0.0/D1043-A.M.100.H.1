He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
He was a billionaire, and more important, a philanthropist.
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
Lebanon has also rejected calls for an international investigation.
It said Hariri was targeted because "he was an agent" for Saudi Arabia.
Hariri, 60, died on Monday when his motorcade was blown up by a suicide car bomber in western Beirut seafront.
It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder.
