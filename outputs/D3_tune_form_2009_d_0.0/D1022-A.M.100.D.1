It is not," Howard said.
Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan.
"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture," he said.
The International Whaling Commission imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan's scientific hunt, in which hundreds of whales are killed each year, is widely regarded as a way of circumventing the moratorium.
Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "scientific research whaling".
