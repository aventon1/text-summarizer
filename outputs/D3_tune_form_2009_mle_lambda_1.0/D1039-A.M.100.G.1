The attacker was arrested.
Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
He was known as a Muslim activist,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified.
``We do not want silence,'' he said, ``we want noise.''
``He was very outspoken, but he was not a racist,'' Hartog said.
''If it happens, it happens,`` van Gogh said.
Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street.
van Gogh was known for his outspoken criticism of Islam.
