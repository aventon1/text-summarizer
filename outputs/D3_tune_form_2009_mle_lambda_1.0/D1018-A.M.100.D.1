A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
Joran remains in police custody with two other young men in the May 30 disappearance of Natalee Holloway, 18.
Van der Sloot, from Holland, is training to be a judge in Aruba, a Dutch Caribbean island.
"They did not know what was going on," she said.
"Those police should be searching or investigating the case instead," said the spokesman.
"You don't hear anything about that."
"This is a place of hospitality, not hostility," he said.
