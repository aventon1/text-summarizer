"There is a possibility."
The hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea.
He said no demands had been announced.
Their other boat was left behind," he said.
Eyewitnesses said the hostages were forced to swim to the boats.
Asked if they had hidden in the bushes, Murphy said, ''We did that.''
''We're tracking them down,'' he added.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
