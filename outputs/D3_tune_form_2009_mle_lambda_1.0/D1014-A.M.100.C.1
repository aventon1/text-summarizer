According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20 percent of middle school students are overweight, "China Daily" reports today.
Kuwaiti women accounted for 50.4 percent of the country's population, which is 708,000.
The growth will be registered in both developed and, especially, developing countries, due to population aging, unhealthy diets, obesity and a secondary lifestyle.
According to his study, 42 percent of Kuwaiti women and 28 percent of men are obese.
Twenty-eight percent of Kuwaiti men are overweight.
