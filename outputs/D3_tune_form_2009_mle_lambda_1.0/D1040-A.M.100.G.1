Blake is accused of murdering Bakley on May 4, 2001.
"That's what this case is all about, the defendant getting what he wants," Samuels said.
Blake, 71, is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder.
Blake, 71, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Bakley.
"Those monsters will never get her," Blake said.
"When the solicitations were unsuccessful, he did it himself," Samuels said.
``Jurors are more likely to identify with witnesses, not with the judge, lawyers or the defendant.''
Blake "is a man of emotions," Schwartzbach said.
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
