"We are trying to seal the leak so that we can resume production as early as possible," he said.
Statoil said it did not know when production would be able to resume.
All other considerations will have to wait," Oeivind Reinertsen, a senior Statoil executive, said in a statement.
The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of 130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day.
Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day.
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia.
