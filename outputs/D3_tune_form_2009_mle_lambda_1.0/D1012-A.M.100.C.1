The cause of the crash, which killed all the 121 people aboard, was unclear, but it was apparently a technical problem, official sources said.
Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for the last hour or so that the plane traveled, on automatic pilot, until crashing, a civil aviation official in Athens said.
The two who entered the cockpit to attempt to control the plane may have been crew or passengers, a government official said.
Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
I saw about 80 dead bodies, some were children," he said.
There were no survivors.
