Earlier in the day, Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
He was a billionaire, and more important, a philanthropist.
Hariri was important to Lebanon as a politician and a symbol.
Hariri, 60, died on Monday when his motorcade was blown up by a suicide car bomber in western Beirut seafront.
Later, at her home, Hariri's wife, Nazik, met President Jacques Chirac of France, a close friend of the ex-prime minister, who had come to pay his condolences.
