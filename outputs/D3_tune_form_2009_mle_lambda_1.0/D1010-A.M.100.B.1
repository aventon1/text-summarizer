The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in the brains of cattle.
Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992, but boosted testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in Alberta in May 2003.
