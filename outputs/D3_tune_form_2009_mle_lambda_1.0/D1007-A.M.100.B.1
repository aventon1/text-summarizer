HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
However, "the transmission of the virus both from bird to human and human to human is possible," Chan said.
Of the five other cases suspected of being infected of the H5N1 virus, four are under treatment in satisfactory condition and one, a 19-year-old girl, is in critical condition, the department said.
