Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
FEMA officials say that regardless of where Hurricane Floyd strikes, the federal response will be far different from the tardy answer to Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.
The National Hurricane Center said Floyd was 470 miles  east-southeast of Miami this afternoon, with wind around the eye blowing at 155 mph.
Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm.
For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
