South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
However, the South Korean president did not mention the fate of the country's Ambassador to the United States Hong Seok-hyun, who was allegedly involved in the slush funds scandal, according to the spokesman.
Former NIS officials told newspapers Monday that the taped conversation was authentic.
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.
