The 5-year-old male was the first of 19 grizzly bears to die in the region surrounding Yellowstone National Park and one of 50 killed in the lower 48 states, making 2004 the worst year for grizzly mortality since the animal was added to the endangered species list in 1975.
Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said he also supported taking bears off the list.
``We know more about this population of grizzly bears than any population of grizzly bears anywhere,'' Manson said, adding the department will monitor the animals' health for five years after they come off the list.
