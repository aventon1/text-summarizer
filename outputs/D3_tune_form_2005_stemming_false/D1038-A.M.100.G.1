Mount St. Helens, the volcano that blew its top with cataclysmic force in 1980, erupted for the first time in 18 years Friday, belching a huge column of white steam and ash after days of rumblings.
A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
Mount St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same intensity.
