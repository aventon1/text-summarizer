Also at Wednesday's hearing, defense attorneys filed motions to see the evidence warranting the continued incarceration of their clients, and prosecutors sought the removal of lawyer Antonio Carlo, who is representing Joran Van Der Sloot.
On Wednesday, investigators brought in from Holland and police using a German Shepherd searched the van der Sloots' one-story, yellow-beige home, where Joran lived in an attached apartment.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again Sunday for questioning and was released.
