(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Shepard died following a brutal beating in Laramie in October.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
Both could get the death penalty.
The trial is expected to last five weeks.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
McKinney's trial is scheduled for August.
