Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
He was arrested April last year.
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial on November 12.
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
