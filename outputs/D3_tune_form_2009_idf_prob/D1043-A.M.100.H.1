"Assad condemned the horrible terrorist act that claimed lives of a number of Lebanese people, notably former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri," SANA said.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.
Hariri wan not perfect -- no human is.
The success of those winds will not come from the outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and women like Rafik Hariri.
At least 14 others were killed.
