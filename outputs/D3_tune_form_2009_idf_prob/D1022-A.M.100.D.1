Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists.
New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan.
It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese news reports said.
"We need to work together to promote conservation."
