WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has rejected a motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
Media reports said Kaczynski's lawyers requested the transfer, which was completed Wednesday, 10 weeks before his trial begins in Sacramento.
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
