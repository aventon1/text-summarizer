HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
``But dioxin can stay in the soil very long.''
In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996,  six other diseases were listed with ``limited or suggestive evidence of association'' to Agent Orange, other herbicides or the contaminant dioxin.
Their use was stopped in 1971, two years after studies first linked Agent Orange to birth defects in laboratory animals.
