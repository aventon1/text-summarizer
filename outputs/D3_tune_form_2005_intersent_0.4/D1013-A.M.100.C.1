Identity theft accounts for about half of the $1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret Service, which monitors the crime.
The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 makes it a felony to commit identity theft.
``Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in America, maybe even the world,'' Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti said at a news conference Wednesday to explain the new law.
Garcetti said the law will give his prosecutors the ammunition they need to fight identity theft.
Identity theft also became a federal felony this year, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
