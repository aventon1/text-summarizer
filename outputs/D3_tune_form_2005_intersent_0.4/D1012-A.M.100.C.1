A Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by a private jetliner Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, with 115 passengers including 48 children and six crew members on board, Greek news media reported.
Fueling the relatives' anger were reports that the plane may have crashed due to a technical fault that had affected Helios planes in the past.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.

It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
There were no survivors.
