It is not," Howard said.
Earlier this week Prime Minister John Howard personally wrote to his Japanese counterpart, Junichiro Koizumi, urging him to scrap the plan to increase Japan's whale kill.
Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "scientific research whaling".
Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court last week to sue the Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
