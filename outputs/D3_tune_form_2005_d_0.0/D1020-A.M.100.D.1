The products, which were distributed nationwide and to foreign  countries including Russia and South Korea by Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City plant, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced.
At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they  had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states.
One recall was for milk.
