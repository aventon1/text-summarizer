John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney.
Earlier this month, Beckner, who has directed the murder investigation since October, said that there were ``30 reasons'' why a grand jury investigation was necessary.
``This is the second time that people have said this grand jury is going to be a fix,'' said the analyst, Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer.
There have been no arrests, although police have said JonBenet's  parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, are under suspicion.
