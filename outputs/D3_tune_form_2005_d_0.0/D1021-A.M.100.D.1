BC-FLA-LAFAVE-DEAL (Tampa) -- Debra Lafave, the former Tampa middle school teacher accused of having sex with a 14-year-old male student, will avoid prison under a plea deal announced Tuesday.
After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was "a fair resolution of this case."
"The victim's family indicated they wanted this case over with," Sinacore said.
"(But) I don't think even (Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons) could anticipate all of the twists and turns and intensity of the media coverage."
"What the victim's family said, was every time this came up the boy would get harassed at school," he said.
"Why is she the sex teacher?"
