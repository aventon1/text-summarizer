Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on land and in water.
The survey, published online by the journal Science, studied the 5,743 known amphibian species and found that at least 1,856 of them face extinction, more than 100 species may already be extinct, and 43 percent are in a population decline -- many for unknown reasons.
Cricket frogs, once abundant, declined dramatically around Chicago and other regions in the 1960s, and the scientists found that the times and places with high rates of hermaphrodites, also called intersexes, overlapped with when and where the frogs disappeared in Illinois.
