"The situation is still serious," Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for the Norwegian oil group Statoil which operates the Snorre A offshore platform, told AFP.
The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
Norway, which is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production of three million barrels, has seen its oil production reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day (bpd) since the platforms were closed.
