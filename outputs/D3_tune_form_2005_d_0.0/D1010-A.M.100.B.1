It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
The person, was not identified publicly, was discovered to have variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), which causes personality change, loss of body function, brain deterioration and eventually death, officials from the health ministry said.
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.
The 14th case in Japan was confirmed last week.
