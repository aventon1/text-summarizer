"This was small explosive eruption from the lava dome that lasted for 24 minutes and generated a plume that rose up to a height of just under 10,000 feet (3,000 meters)," said USGS volcano and hydrology expert John Major.
Scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens, which erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years with a minor explosion, said on Saturday that they were expecting a more powerful eruption within a day or so.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the volcano, which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980, was shaken by a "tremor burst" for 25 minutes.
"We're just watching," she said.
