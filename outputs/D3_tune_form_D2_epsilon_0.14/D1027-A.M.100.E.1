(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
The other man charged in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 21, is set  to go on trial in August.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  convicted.
