President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case, his spokesman Kim Man-Soo said.
Hong has offered to resign the ambassadorship.
A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
