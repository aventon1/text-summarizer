"The center of Floyd is still in the formative stage, but it has intensified," said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.
Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
