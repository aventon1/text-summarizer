Larry King, Matt Lauer, Greta Van Susteren - they all wanted Debra Lafave, the former Tampa teacher accused of seducing a teenage boy.
"He did not from the get go want to harm Debra Lafave.
This was someone that he liked," Sinacore said.
Debra Lafave, 25, will serve three years of house arrest and seven years of probation.
No matter where she goes, life will not be the same for Debra Lafave.
After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was "a fair resolution of this case."
The agreement was meant to resolve charges against Debra Lafave, 25, in two counties.
