The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand jury.
``God knows, and He's not telling.''
The Ramseys have denied any involvement.
``Everything in our lives has been scoured,'' Patsy said.
``The case is going to the grand jury,'' Jim Carpenter, the governor's spokesman, said on Thursday.
The grand jury will begin hearing evidence later this month, Laurion said.
Romer also considered a Ramsey family friend's claim that Hunter's friendship with lawyers representing John and Patsy Ramsey clouded his judgment on the case.
The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
They will know it is you.''
