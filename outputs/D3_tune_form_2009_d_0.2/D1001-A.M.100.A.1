Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves.
Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts from the popular students at Columbine.
``They are indeed dangerous places,'' Graham said.
``I'm fine with it,'' he said.
Since the massacre, the suburban school has become a sealed  crime scene.
``We wouldn't have played,'' he said.
