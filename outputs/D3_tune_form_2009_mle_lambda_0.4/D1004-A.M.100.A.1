PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said Sunday.
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west of the village on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another.
The beaches are clean,'' Cassey said.
