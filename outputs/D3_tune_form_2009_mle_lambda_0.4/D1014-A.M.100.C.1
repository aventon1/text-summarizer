The study shows that the 12 percent obesity is close to the standard in developed countries.
The survey indicated that differences in age, gender, and education levels can influence the ratio of obesity.
Fifteen percent of female adults suffer from obesity, while the level among male adults 10.68 percent.
However, more boys suffer from obesity than girls.
Kuwait has started this medical experiment on obesity cases recently.
According to his study, 42 percent of Kuwaiti women and 28 percent of men are obese.
Twenty-eight percent of Kuwaiti men are overweight.
Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said.
