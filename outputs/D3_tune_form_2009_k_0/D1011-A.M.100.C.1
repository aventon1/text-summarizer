An appetite-curbing hormone that failed to live up to its early buzz as a possible key to slowing obesity is now being probed as a potential aid for women who suffer from infertility and eating disorders.
"This represents essentially a new era for leptin," said Dr. Jean Chan, one of the researchers exploring new uses for the hormone.
"Now that we understand so much more about what this hormone does, we can target it appropriately for the right condition."
Authors of the study also said there were some preliminary signs that the hormone improved bone density, which begins to decline when women stop menstruating.
