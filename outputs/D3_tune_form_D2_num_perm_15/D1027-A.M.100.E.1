``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Both men could get the death  penalty.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  convicted.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
