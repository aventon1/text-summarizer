More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs, a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years.
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
The conservation union -- which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species -- also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
