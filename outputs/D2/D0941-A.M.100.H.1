The European Space Agency built and managed the development of Huygens and directs the probe's operations.
The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mother probe on Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan for an on-site study of the atmosphere of Titan.
The Huygens probe, designed and built by the European Space Agency, had been carried by NASA's Saturn probe Cassini, which entered the orbit of Saturn on June 30 after a nearly seven-year journey in the space.
Huygens was designed for only a brief mission.
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan.
