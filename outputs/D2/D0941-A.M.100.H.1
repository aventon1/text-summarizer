The European Space Agency built and managed the development of Huygens and directs the probe's operations.
One of the great mysteries of the Huygens visit will be what kind of landscape greets the probe.
The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, after which the probe will begin sending data back to Earth.
The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mother probe on Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan for an on-site study of the atmosphere of Titan.
Huygens was designed for only a brief mission.
