Children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia when they grow older, according to research published on Friday.
Doctors in Sweden and Britain spotted the statistical risk after sifting through the medical records of 712,000 people born in Sweden between 1973 and 1980.
They identified 639 people who had been hospitalised with schizophrenia at some point between 1989 and 2001.
Only four of these were siblings.
More than 15 percent of cases may have been due to the fact that the patient had a father who was aged over 30 years at birth, they believe.
