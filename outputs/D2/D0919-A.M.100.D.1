So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.
In a surprise announcement, Britain's heir to the throne, Prince Charles, declared on Thursday that he will marry his lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.
Parker Bowles will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take over the title of princess of Wales that was bestowed on her predecessor, Diana, whose marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly over her.
Diana died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in a Paris car accident.
It will take place on Friday 8th April, 2005, at Windsor Castle.''
