Prince Charles is to marry his partner Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince's office said Thursday.
"I'm delighted for the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles," Blair said in a statement broadcast on British TV.
Prince Charles and his longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles _ both divorcees _ will be married in a civil ceremony, not in a Church of England service.
Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marrying Camilla Parker Bowles than oppose it.
They remained friends but Diana blamed Charles' relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also married, for the failure of their union.
