The trial whose results pulled Vioxx off the market was designed to check how well 25 mg of Vioxx did in preventing recurrence of polyps in the colon.
The additional, more serious step taken Monday reflects the momentum in the Vioxx litigation and the delay in launching Arcoxia, Vioxx's successor drugs, said S&P analyst Arthur Wong.
