Steve Fossett is waiting on the wind.
The Global Flyer won't be the first airplane to circle the world without refueling.
The Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer -- first sketched by Rutan on the back of a napkin in 1999 -- is undoubtedly one of the strangest-looking flying machines ever to take wing over the Kansas heartland.
Its 12,300-foot runway and a 1,300-foot overrun -- built when it was Schilling Air Force Base -- provide plenty of room for the Global Flyer to get up to takeoff speed.
The most serious problem was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, or GPS, Fossett's satellite navigation aid.
