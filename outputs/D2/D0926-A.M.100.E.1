The Global Flyer won't be the first airplane to circle the world without refueling.
Its 12,300-foot runway and a 1,300-foot overrun -- built when it was Schilling Air Force Base -- provide plenty of room for the Global Flyer to get up to takeoff speed.
The Global Flyer carries only enough fuel to cover 20,000 miles in still air -- a good 3,000 miles short of the 36,787.559-kilometer minimum distance required for the arbiter of world aviation records, the Paris-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, to recognize the feat.
The most serious problem was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, or GPS, Fossett's satellite navigation aid.
