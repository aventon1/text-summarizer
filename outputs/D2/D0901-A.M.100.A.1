Markets are overcrowded, traffic jam is heavy and the shops are jostling with shoppers in the capital city of Srinagar in the Indian-administered Kashmir as the holy Moslem festival of Eid approaches here.
Kashmiris are known as incorrigible festive shoppers and because of that reputation, unscrupulous shopkeepers have been minting money by over-charging the locals for everything from a chop of mutton to the chickens and hosiery items that the locals must buy to protect themselves from the biting cold of the winter.
Kashmir is a very tricky situation.
One grenade blast can put things back by months here.
