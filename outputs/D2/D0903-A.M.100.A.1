Spain has provided a US$54.4 million (euro43.4 million) long-term loan to fund a solar power project for remote villages in the central and southern Philippines, officials said Friday.
The four-year project, which began in 2003, will initially cover communities that have benefited from the government's agrarian reform program in 16 provinces on the main southern island of Mindanao, acting Land Reform Secretary Nasser Pangandaman said.
The Philippines will provide a US$8.7 million (euro6.9 million) counterpart fund for the project, which will also help the country diversify its energy sources.
And Hurricane Katrina, of course, has worsened the situation.
Voila!
