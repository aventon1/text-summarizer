The leader of Nepal, King Gyanendra, unexpectedly dissolved the government and claimed absolute power Tuesday, justifying the moves as necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of a Maoist insurgency that has spread to nearly every corner of the picturesque Himalayan nation.
Political opponents described the action as a coup.
International air service was suspended, phone and Internet connections were cut and the army was reported to be patrolling streets in the capital of Katmandu.
Security personnel surrounded the home of the prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, according to news agency reports.
But the mood was clearly tense.
