Northern Ireland's 7-year-old peace accord will eventually work but requires the Irish Republican Army to deliver a "clear and decisive" end to all its activities, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Friday.
In a speech to British and Irish academics at University College Dublin, Ahern said the U.S.-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 contained a complex set of goals that, if achieved, would ensure a stable, peaceful Northern Ireland.
The major Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists, refuses to cooperate with Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most Catholics, citing the IRA's continued underground activities.
The Rev.
