A man intent on committing suicide left his car on a railroad track in Glendale near downtown Los Angeles Wednesday, where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains, killing at least 10 people and injuring nearly 200, authorities said.
Police arrested a man who they said would be charged with homicide in the crash that left train cars mangled and seared.
Debris including seat cushions, bloody towels and luggage discarded by fleeing passengers littered the area.
The investigation was continuing.
Distraught and remorseful, Alvarez told police he had left the vehicle and watched the derailment, Adams said.
