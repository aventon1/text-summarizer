Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, delivered weapons grade highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001, and Iran aims at getting a nuclear bomb next year, an Iranian opposition group said in Vienna Wednesday.
The government expressed skepticism Thursday over a claim by an Iranian opposition group that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced father of Pakistan's nuclear program, had given Iran a blueprint for a nuclear bomb and some weapons-grade uranium.
"We do not attach importance to this report or claim," Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan told a news conference in the capital, Islamabad.
