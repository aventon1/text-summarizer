City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents each for grocery bags to discourage use of plastic sacks.
In San Francisco, the free grocery bag soon might go the way of the full-service gas station.
Of those, 90 percent are nonrecyclable plastic.
My column explained that the San Francisco Department of the Environment came up with the 17 cents by dividing the environmental cost of used grocery bags ($8.5 million annually) by the estimated number of plastic and paper bags distributed in San Francisco supermarkets each year (50 million).
If you don't get plastic bags with your groceries, then you would have to buy plastic bags.
