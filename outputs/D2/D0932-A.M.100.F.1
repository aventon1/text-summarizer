The Rwandan government has launched a national war against plastic bags as an attempt to maintain the environment and clean up the country, President Paul Kagame told reporters Monday.
Kagame who participated in the clean-up of the Kigali city said that his government had endorsed the ban on all plastic bags and anyone who still owns them ought to face penalties.
"We want people to use traditional baskets and give the land a breathing space," Kagame said.
However, shop owners feel the government's decision was to hostile and too heavy for them.
"This is a sensible user fee."
he writes.
