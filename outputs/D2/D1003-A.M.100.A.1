Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located.
Giant pandas, said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs, are cited as a "national gem" of China.
Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
Giant pandas also continue to face threats from humans such as poaching, mining and logging, the report said.
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
