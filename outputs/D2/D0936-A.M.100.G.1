Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman ever appointed to the US Supreme Court, said Friday that she is retiring, giving US president George W. Bush his first opportunity to appoint a justice.
"This is to inform you of my decision to retire from my position as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, effective upon the nomination and confirmation of my successor," she said in a letter to Bush.
O'Connor, 75, did not explain why she was resigning.
A Supreme Court spokeswoman said O'Connor needs to spend time with her husband who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
