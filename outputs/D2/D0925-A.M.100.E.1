In a risky move that could further shrink its minuscule slice of the PC market, Apple Computer Inc. announced plans Monday to switch its Macintosh computers to the same Intel Corp. chips used in systems that run Microsoft Windows.
Intel expressed delight at Apple's switch.
Apple Computer is expected to announce Monday that it will begin using Intel chips in its Macintosh machines next year, ending a 14-year alliance with IBM and its processors, according to US media reports.
Apple could also lose sales in the coming months as customers wait for the switch to the more powerful Intel processors.
