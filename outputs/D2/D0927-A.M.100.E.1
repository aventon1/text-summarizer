Peter Jennings, the sole anchor of the ABC evening newscast for the past 22 years, announced Tuesday that he was suffering from lung cancer and had begun treatment.
"Peter is an old friend," Brokaw said Tuesday.
``Peter's been given a tough assignment,'' Westin added.
Peter will once again lead the way, but we will stand with him at every turn.''
``Peter is part of the DNA of ABC News,'' said spokesman Jeffrey Schneider.
Jennings joined ABC News in 1964.
The first message was posted just six minutes after the news broke April 5 that ABC anchor Peter Jennings had been diagnosed with lung cancer.
