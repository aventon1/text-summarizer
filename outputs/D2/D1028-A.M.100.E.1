Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento.
David and Wanda turned in Theodore Kaczynski last year after authorities had mounted an unsuccessful 18-year search for the Unabomber.
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
But Burrell disagreed, saying that threats to witnesses in the 18-year Unabomber case "raise the specter that juror safety is potentially at risk."
-- Lawyers are set to make opening statements Monday in trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski.
