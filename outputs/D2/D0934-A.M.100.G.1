Top Palestinian officials abruptly postponed a trip to Paris on Monday to ascertain the real condition of ailing leader Yasser Arafat after critical comments by his wife, a spokesman said Monday.
Arafat's deputy in the Palestine Liberation Organization, Mahmoud Abbas, and Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, were asked by the Fatah central committee on Sunday to speak directly to Arafat's doctors, Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian minister, said Sunday evening.
"They are trying to bury Abu Ammar alive," she said, using Arafat's nom de guerre.
We want to hear from the doctors directly."
Officials categorically deny reports that he is dead.
