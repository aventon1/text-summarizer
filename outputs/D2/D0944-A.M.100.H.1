For release Sunday, Oct. 3   WASHINGTON -- The death penalty, drugs and civil rights are before the Supreme Court in its new term, which begins Monday with relatively little public notice amid the presidential campaign's final month.
While President Bush and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., pound away at each other on the stump, the nine justices will start their session at 10 a.m. with the court's marshal saying, "God save the United States and this honorable court."
The justices this year have already shown that they are not afraid to revisit earlier rulings.
