The U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 barred the death penalty for those 15 and younger.
The case is Roper vs. Simmons.
The Missouri Supreme Court commuted Simmons' sentence to life in prison in 2003, and the state has appealed that decision.
The Supreme Court increasingly has looked at international opinion.
The Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-old offenders in 1989.
