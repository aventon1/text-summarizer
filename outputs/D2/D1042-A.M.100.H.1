Lynndie England testified Monday as she pleaded guilty to seven abuse-related charges.
Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
The defense on Monday demanded that the judge be changed for the court martial of Private Lynndie England, the US soldier seen in photographs from Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison holding a leash attached to the neck of a naked inmate.
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
The prisoner then crawled out of the cell with England holding the strap.
