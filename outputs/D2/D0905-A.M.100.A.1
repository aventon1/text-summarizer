But a wind farm with hundreds or even thousands of large turbines removes an enormous amount of energy from the air.
Wind turbines have been hailed as an environmentally friendly way to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels.
Supporters of wind farms have called the proposed turbines "futuristic" and "beautiful," while opponents have called them a blight on an uninterrupted seascape.
Often, he said, the distant view from shore is obscured by haze, so the turbines would not be so obvious.
Eventually, some experts think, wind power may become competitive as turbines get bigger and as pollution taxes are imposed on fossil fuel energy, as planned.
