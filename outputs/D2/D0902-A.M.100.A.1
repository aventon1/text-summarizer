Peru's health minister said Monday that government plans to distribute morning-after birth control pills at public health clinics will begin as scheduled in January, despite an attempt by conservative lawmakers in this predominantly Roman Catholic country to have her prosecuted for promoting abortion.
"The decision is made and there is no turning back," Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti told reporters.
"This is not based on personal beliefs, but in technical and scientific studies that show the pill is not abortive."
To be effective, it must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse.
The company expects a decision next year.
