"Gas is no longer appearing on the sea surface," said Terje Overvik, executive vice president for Statoil's exploration and production Norway, adding that work was still ongoing to permanently secure the well.
It's complicated work," he added.
"Work to secure the well on the Snorre A platform ... continued all through the night, and is still going well and according to plan today ...
"We still have a fair amount of work to do before we can resume production," Oivind Reinertsen, a senior Statoil official, said in the statement.
Statoil pumped cement into the production well to permanently cap it and prevent any further leaks.
