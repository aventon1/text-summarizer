Still without approval from baseball club owners or the city they plan to call home, the Washington Nationals were born Monday in a sea of red, white and blue.
These are not your grandfather's Washington Nationals, because those Nationals played in the American League and were alternately called the Senators.
The new National League Nationals were named not only before they have approval to play in the nation's capital, but also before they have a new owner.
For what some people expect to be $400 million to $500 million, the new guy doesn't get to name his team.
Why?
