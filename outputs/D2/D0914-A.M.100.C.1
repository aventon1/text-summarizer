Three explosions shook three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with vacationing Israelis on Thursday night, killing at least 35 people and wounding about 100, according to officials from Egypt, Israel and nearby hospitals.
Israeli officials said they believed the blasts were caused by terrorist bombs.
In the largest explosion, early reports suggested that a truck bomb may have been driven into the Taba Hilton, a large concrete resort hotel in a little village just across the Israeli border and near the Israeli resort town of Eilat.
There were reports of people buried in the rubble.
