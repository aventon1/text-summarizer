The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
A spokesman for the Nam Yue (Group) Co. LTD., which imports birds from China's inland areas for Macao, said that the company's daily chicken shipment to Macao has dropped about 30 percent.
But it said the risk of infection is low because the H5N1 virus was only found in imported chicken so far.
