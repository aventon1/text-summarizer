Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church convene in the Sistine Chapel this afternoon for a session that could produce the first ballot for a successor to Pope John Paul II, although such swift resolution seems unlikely.

The cardinals also must seek a global pastor with enough charisma to flourish in an image-driven age.
For the first time, credible papal contenders come from at least three distinct regions: Europe, Africa and Latin America.
