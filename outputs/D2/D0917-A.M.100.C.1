And then, the election begins.
Led by Ratzinger, the cardinals pledged ``secrecy regarding everything that in any way relates to the election of the Roman Pontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election....'' They swore ``not to break this secret in any way, either during or after the election of the new Pontiff, unless explicit authorization is granted by the same Pontiff,'' and they promised to resist any intervention by ``secular authorities'' or anyone else in the election of the pope.
"This election involves not only the church, but all of humanity."
Two-thirds, or 77 votes, are needed for election in the early rounds of voting.
