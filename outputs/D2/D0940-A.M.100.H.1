Commissioner for Tourism Eva Cheng Wednesday said the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland will be divided into three phases from early August in order to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated start.
"The idea of a phased opening is to give the theme park, public transport operators and relevant departments a familiarization period to adjust their operation and services," Cheng said.
From early August to mid-August, the Disneyland Resort Line is scheduled to run between Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort Stations.
A section of the Park Promenade linked to the line will be opened.
Disney's tab comes in much smaller.
