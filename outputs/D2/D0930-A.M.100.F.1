So-called carbon sequestration is not a new idea.
Plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxide and can be combined with a futuristic option called "carbon sequestration," in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected into oil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.
These include "clean" coal and carbon sequestration, in which carbon dioxide gas is pumped into geological chambers and stored there, rather than released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned in power stations.
However, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman recently announced that the government would spend $100 million on moving "sequestration technology from the laboratory to the field."
