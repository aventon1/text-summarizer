Some Texas geologists believe the best way to get rid of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is to simply put it back where it came from.
On Monday, scientists began burying 3,000 tons of compressed carbon dioxide 1 mile beneath an old oil field near Dayton.
If the plan works, most carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas -- could be captured from area smokestacks and stored harmlessly underground, not pumped into the atmosphere.
So-called carbon sequestration is not a new idea.
Annually, man-made sources of carbon dioxide emit 7 to 10 billion tons of the gas.
