US National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield warned that people in some areas still recovering from Hurricane Katrina should be watching Rita.
More than 7,000 Hurricane Katrina survivors taking refuge in Texas shelters were being uprooted again Tuesday as Hurricane Rita threatened the state neighboring Louisiana, officials said.
Churning undiminished toward the warm and wide Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Rita could strengthen to Category 4 intensity as it approaches Texas later this week, said Colin McAdie, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
"Texas right now bears the greatest threat from Hurricane Rita," Passey said.
She requested $10 million in assistance.
