Chess genius Bobby Fischer, now in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the United States, will be allowed to leave Japan for Iceland if that country grants him citizenship, an opposition party leader said Wednesday.
"Mr Fischer would be free if he were not Mr Fischer," said Masako Suzuki, his lawyer.
A parliamentary committee met here Thursday to discuss granting citizenship to Bobby Fischer, but made no decision, saying it needed more information from Japan, where the mercurial chess genius is being held in custody.
Iceland's parliament voted Monday to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S. chess star Bobby Fischer.
