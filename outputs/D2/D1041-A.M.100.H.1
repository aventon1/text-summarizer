IUCN on Friday launched a report named "2004 Status of Coral Reefs of the World" at the 3rd World Conservation Conference, which is being held in Bangkok from Nov. 17 to Nov. 25.
"Reefs need our help, but they're not going to go extinct," said Clive Wilkinson, the study's lead author and coordinator of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.
Coral reefs are among the oldest and most diverse forms of life.
Coral could also have been damaged by exposure to the air as water was sucked back from the shore before the tsunamis hit.
