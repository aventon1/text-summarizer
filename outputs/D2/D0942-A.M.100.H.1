An official of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that the government will closely monitor developments in mainland China's communications with the United States about its plan to enact an anti-secession law.
MAC Deputy Chairman Chiu Tai-shan made the remarks a day after Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council, arrived in Washington to discuss with U.S. officials the details of the planned anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
The president made the remarks while reviewing the operations and capability of an army unit in Pingtung, southern Taiwan.
