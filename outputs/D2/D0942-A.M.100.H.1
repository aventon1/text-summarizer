The president reiterated remarks he made in his New Year's address in which he condemned Beijing's plans to enact an anti-secession law as a unilateral attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
Furthermore, he continued, the enacting of the anti-secession law will squeeze the political space of those who actually support Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.
The mainland's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's Congress -- is scheduled to screen the so-called anti-secession law in March.
Greene expressed concern about the DPP's attitude toward the "anti-secession law" and whether it will promote a law to counteract it, Lai said.
