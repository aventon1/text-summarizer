John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney.
In addition, investigators from Hunter's office traveled two weeks ago to the Ramsey's new home in Atlanta and conducted three interviews with Burke Ramsey, the little girl's 11-year-old brother.
White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
There have been no arrests, although police have said JonBenet's  parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, are under suspicion.
