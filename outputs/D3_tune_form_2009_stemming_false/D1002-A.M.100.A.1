Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
Diallo was hit 19 times.
The defendants remain on restricted duty pending the outcome of  the trial, which is scheduled for January.
