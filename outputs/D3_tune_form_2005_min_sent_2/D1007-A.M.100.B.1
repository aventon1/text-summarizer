A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
The virus is believed to be transmitted through contact with birds or their feces.
