The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
"The implication of counsel in opening argument is that Robert Blake is being prosecuted because he is Robert Blake and a regular John Doe wouldn't be prosecuted under the same circumstances," Samuels said.
Robert Blake starred in such films as "In Cold Blood" and in TV shows like "Baretta," but he couldn't pull off the role of a distraught husband, a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in the actor's murder trial.
"Those monsters will never get her," Blake said.
