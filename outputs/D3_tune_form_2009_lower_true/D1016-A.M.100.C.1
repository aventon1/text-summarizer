Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its business dealings.
Demonstrators and opposition leaders have been demanding that an investigation be conducted into whether Soeharto and his family accumulated wealth illegally while he was in power.
Gen. A. Wahab Mokodongan said he was not adverse to an investigation by the Attorney General's office into corruption under Soeharto.
Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.
The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials, former officials and their families.
