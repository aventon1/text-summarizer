The "bird flu" has claimed four victims here, killing two, including a 54-year-old man who died Friday.
No bird flu case has been found in Macao and people should stay calm, experts from the Macao Nurses' Association and the Public Health Department said.
The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
