(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did  not participate in Shepard's beating.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  convicted.
