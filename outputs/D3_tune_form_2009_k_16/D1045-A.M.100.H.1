The Nov. 13 blast in Jilin, a city in Jilin province, caused massive amounts of benzene, a toxic, flammable liquid to flow into the Songhua River.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
Harbin, a city of more than 3 million residents, stops drawing water from the Songhua River for four days starting Wednesday.
Zhang said as the polluted water flows downstream, the density of pollutants has markedly subsided.
