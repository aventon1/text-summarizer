The severity of the global threat to thousands of species of frogs, salamanders and other amphibians makes them perhaps the most endangered class of animals on Earth, with their rapid decline outpacing that of mammals and birds.
About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat.
There aren't any frogs left in those areas to collect.''
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
