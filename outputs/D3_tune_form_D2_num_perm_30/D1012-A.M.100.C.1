A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, a spokesman for Helios Airways was quoted by Athens News Agency as saying.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.
