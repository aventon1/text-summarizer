The suspect in the murder of film maker Theo van Gogh, known for his controversial views on Islam, had ties with a group of extremist Muslims monitored by the intelligence services, the Dutch government said here late Tuesday.
Some 20,000 people gathered in Amsterdam late Tuesday to pay homage to controversial Dutch filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh who was murdered in the street.
"We ask the inhabitants of Amsterdam to keep cool and cope calmly with this murder and to bid farewell in a dignified manner to Theo van Gogh," the Moroccan Municipal Assembly in Amsterdam said, calling the murder despicable.
