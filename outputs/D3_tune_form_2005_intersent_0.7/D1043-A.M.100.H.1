Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
The Lebanese interior minister said on Tuesday that initial indications showed that former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a suicide car bombing.
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
He always had vision.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.
The success of those winds will not come from the outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and women like Rafik Hariri.
