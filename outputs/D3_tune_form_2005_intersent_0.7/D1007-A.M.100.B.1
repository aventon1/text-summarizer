Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.

Because strict preventive measures have been taken for a long period, Zhao said, there has been no bird flu epidemic in recent years among Shenzhen's 168 chicken runs and 38 pigeon farms.
