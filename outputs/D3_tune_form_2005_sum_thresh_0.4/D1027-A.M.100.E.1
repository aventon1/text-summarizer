Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school  dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him.
(AP) -- Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as  jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard to death.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
