Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
``It's beautiful,'' said Penalver.
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph.
FEMA officials say that regardless of where Hurricane Floyd strikes, the federal response will be far different from the tardy answer to Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.
