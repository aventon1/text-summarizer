Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
"This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's Stephanie Hanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted.
On May 18, 1980, after weeks of quakes, slides and tremors, of belching smoke, steam and ash, Mount St. Helens, a major peak in the Cascade mountain chain, erupted.
"We had to come back here when this happened," she said.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
Mount St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same intensity.
