Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Alaskan grizzly bears, which number around 30,000, were never listed under the act.
Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said he also supported taking bears off the list.
Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600 pounds.
Bears within the parks would remain federally protected.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears now live in the region, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.
