Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.
South Korean television and newspapers have released what they called a taped private conversation between ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun and a top official of the country's largest conglomerate Samsung in 1997.
In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.
