A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
Fueling the relatives' anger were reports that the plane may have crashed due to a technical fault that had affected Helios planes in the past.
The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials said.
How that did not happen (with the Helios flight) is extremely strange.''
That was the last contact.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
There were no survivors.
