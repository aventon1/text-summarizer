Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is training to be a judge in Aruba.
Authorities have not released the results of the search, but Attorney General Caren Janssen has said that Paul van der Sloot is not under investigation.
