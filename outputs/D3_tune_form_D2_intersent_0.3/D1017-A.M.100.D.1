Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
