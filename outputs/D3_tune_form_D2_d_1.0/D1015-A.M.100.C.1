Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest.
Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China.
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
