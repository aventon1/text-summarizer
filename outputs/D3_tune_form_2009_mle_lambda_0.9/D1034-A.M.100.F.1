About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
The new study has limitations.
Also, the scientists could not compare frogs from the same lakes or ponds over time.
The hospital, which is part of the Frog Decline Reversal Project, received no government funding, she said, adding this may have been because frogs were not "iconic" Australian animals such as koalas or kangaroos.
