The cause of the crash, which killed all the 121 people aboard, was unclear, but it was apparently a technical problem, official sources said.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
It was unclear whether they were passengers or pilots.
Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
I saw about 80 dead bodies, some were children," he said.
There were no survivors.
The pilots of the F-16s said they saw the jet's co-pilot slumped over the controls and the pilot was not in the cockpit.
"There is wreckage everywhere," Grammatiko Mayor George Papageorgiou said.
