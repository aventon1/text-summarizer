A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
"Mr. Van Der Sloot!"
The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again Sunday for questioning and was released.
