(AP) -- Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as  jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard to death.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney  brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs said.
McKinney's trial is scheduled for August.
Both men could get the death  penalty.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  convicted.
