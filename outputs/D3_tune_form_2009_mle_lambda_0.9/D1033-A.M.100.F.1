In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.
Kim said there had been no illicit wiretapping under the government of President Roh Moo-Hyun.
Kim Dae-jung's office expressed "profound regret" over the spy agency's admission of wiretapping during his government.
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
