Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
It said Hariri was targeted because "he was an agent" for Saudi Arabia.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.
It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder.
