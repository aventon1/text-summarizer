The Nov. 13 blast in Jilin, a city in Jilin province, caused massive amounts of benzene, a toxic, flammable liquid to flow into the Songhua River.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
It has compelled cities along the river to suspend water taking from the river for various periods.
Zhang said as the polluted water flows downstream, the density of pollutants has markedly subsided.
As the public has been informed timely, no human being has been harmed, said the SEPA official.
