Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
Lynndie England testified Monday as she pleaded guilty to seven abuse-related charges.
Prosecutors described Graner, who is said to be England's ex-boyfriend, as the ringleader of a group of Abu Ghraib guards who mistreated Iraqi detainees.
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
England has yet to be sentenced by the military court hearing her case.
England said she believed Graner took the pictures "for his own amusement."
``I knew it was wrong,'' she said.
