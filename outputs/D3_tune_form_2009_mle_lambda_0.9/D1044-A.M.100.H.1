Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
A total of 474 food products are now being recalled, amid fears they could contain traces of Sudan I _ a red dye used for coloring oils, waxes, petrol and shoe polish.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.
The list of recalled foods includes dressings used by McDonald's fast food chain, packets of potato chips and pre-prepared meals.
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
