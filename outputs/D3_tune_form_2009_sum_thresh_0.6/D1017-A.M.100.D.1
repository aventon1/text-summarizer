Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
FEMA officials say that regardless of where Hurricane Floyd strikes, the federal response will be far different from the tardy answer to Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.
``We are going to feel it,'' he said.
For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
