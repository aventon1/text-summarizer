"The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.
Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said he also supported taking bears off the list.
``We know more about this population of grizzly bears than any population of grizzly bears anywhere,'' Manson said, adding the department will monitor the animals' health for five years after they come off the list.
Federal grizzly bear biologists in Montana say that years of research shows that the bear population around Yellowstone is robust and recovered.
