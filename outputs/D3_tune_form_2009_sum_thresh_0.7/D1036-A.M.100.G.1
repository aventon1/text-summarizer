But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
His head has not been found.
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
"There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," said Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment."
