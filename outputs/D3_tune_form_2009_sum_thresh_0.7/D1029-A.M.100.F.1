During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Thursday's fighting in Dera Bugti _ about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields _ was an alarming escalation of a low-level tribal rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province.
Officials have said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen, who dominate Dera Bugti.
During the 1970s the government brutally put down a major nationalist uprising in Baluchistan, leading to long-lasting distrust and resentment on both sides.
