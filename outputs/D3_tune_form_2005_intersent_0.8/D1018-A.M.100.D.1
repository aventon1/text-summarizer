A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
Players had to sign in, she said, and that gave them a name and initial: Joran V.   "After talking to enough people, we were able to deduce that it was Joran van der Sloot," she said.
Still accompanied by police, the group went to a couple of places looking for van der Sloot before returning to the father's house and finding Joran van der Sloot there with one of the two Surinamese brothers who later were detained, she said.
