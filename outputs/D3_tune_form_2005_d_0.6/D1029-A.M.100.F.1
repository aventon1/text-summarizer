The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.
No government official was immediately available Friday to answer Mengal's claim.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov.
