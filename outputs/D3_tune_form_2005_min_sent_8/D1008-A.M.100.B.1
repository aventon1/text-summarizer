For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters.
Just a few miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Annapolis, the waters of Kent Narrows, which leads to the bay, were home to 13 oyster packing houses at about the time Harris' opened in 1947.
The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
As a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the algae and other particles in the bay, the menhaden ``ecologically speaking, (is) the most important animal'' in the bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation says.
