The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas.
The Qinling pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about 50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said.
The nature preserve, occupying about 220,000 hectares, has 102 giant pandas living wild.
In Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, two other habitats of giant pandas, arrow bamboo was also found blooming.
Bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report said.
Currently more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
