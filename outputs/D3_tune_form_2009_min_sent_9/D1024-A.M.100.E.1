U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six Tomahawk missiles.
