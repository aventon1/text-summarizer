The front of the polluted water of Songhua River in northeast China reached Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province, on early Thursday morning, local environment authority said.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
Harbin, a city of more than 3 million residents, stops drawing water from the Songhua River for four days starting Wednesday.
Zhang said as the polluted water flows downstream, the density of pollutants has markedly subsided.
