KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
White smoke still rose from the rubble of the four-story building, which the United States said was making chemical weapons agents.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
He described El-Shifa as ``the largest pharmaceutical factory we had in this country'' and added: ``We never produced any chemical material.''
