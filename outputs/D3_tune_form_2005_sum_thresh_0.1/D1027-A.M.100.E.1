(AP) -- Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as  jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard to death.
McKinney's trial is scheduled for August.
Authorities said the pair pretended to be homosexual and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a downtown bar before they beat him and then left him lashed to a fence in a remote area east of town.
