Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
The success of those winds will not come from the outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and women like Rafik Hariri.
The crowd began massing quietly in front of Rafik Hariri's mansion in the early dawn hours Wednesday as Lebanon prepared to bury him and the six bodyguards who were killed with him in a bomb blast on Monday.
