The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``The aim was to kill me.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
