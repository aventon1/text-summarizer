Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a condition that has been labeled "purging disorder" by Dr. Pamela Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.
She said the mixed eating disorder label "may have the benefit of eliminating the false impression that EDNOS is somehow less severe or less clinically significant than so-called full-threshold eating disorders."
The other group had no prior history of eating disorders, but a life event -- a divorce, loss of parent or job -- triggered an eating disorder.
