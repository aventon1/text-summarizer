South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Hong was president of JoongAng Daily, one of three most influential newspapers in South Korea, at that time.
"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping," National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to reporters.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
