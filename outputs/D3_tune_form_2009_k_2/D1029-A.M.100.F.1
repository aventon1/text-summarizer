During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui.
Lasi said all 3,314 officials and their families would leave Dera Bugti, which lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields and 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the provincial capital, Quetta.
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight.
