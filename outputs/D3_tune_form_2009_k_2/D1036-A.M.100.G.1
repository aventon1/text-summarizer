Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades.
In recent weeks, medical experts in various countries have said the facial condition appeared to be chloracne, which is associated with dioxin poisoning.
Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.
The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
