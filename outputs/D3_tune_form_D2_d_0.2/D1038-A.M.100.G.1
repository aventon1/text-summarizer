A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
After 18 years on inactivity, St. Helens roared back to life Friday with a giant plume of steam and ash.
"This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's Stephanie Hanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted.
Mount St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same intensity.
