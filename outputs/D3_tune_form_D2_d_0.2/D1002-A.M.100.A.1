Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether the officers waive their right to a jury trial.
The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial.
