The suspect in the murder of film maker Theo van Gogh, known for his controversial views on Islam, had ties with a group of extremist Muslims monitored by the intelligence services, the Dutch government said here late Tuesday.
"Van Gogh was provocative but you have to be allowed to provoke people, that is freedom of speech," said Koos, a 21-year old political science student at the gathering.
The film by Van Gogh, 47, the great-grandson of painter Vincent Van Gogh's brother, was aired in August on Dutch television, drawing the ire of some Muslims.
van Gogh was known for his outspoken criticism of Islam.
