Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
A total of 474 food products are now being recalled, amid fears they could contain traces of Sudan I _ a red dye used for coloring oils, waxes, petrol and shoe polish.
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
