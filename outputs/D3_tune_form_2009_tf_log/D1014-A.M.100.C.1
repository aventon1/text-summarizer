BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Armed with new surveys showing high rates of childhood anemia, obesity, and short stature, nutritionists in Guangzhou are pushing for more attention to local children's diets both at home and school.
According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20 percent of middle school students are overweight, "China Daily" reports today.
Many spoiled teenagers from one-child families eat only a particular kind of food, such as meat or sweets, which might easily lead them to develop obesity, diabetes or heart disease.
Kuwait has started this medical experiment on obesity cases recently.
