At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.
"Mangroves contribute directly to rural livelihoods by providing wood and non-wood forest products _ including timber, poles, fuel wood and thatch for houses," said Mette Loyche Wilkie, an agency expert, "and indirectly by providing spawning grounds and nutrients for fish and shellfish."
"Here, there has been very little impact," said S. Ramamurthy, the officer in charge of the forests, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) south of Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu state.
"This is likely to lead to further pressure on the coastal forests, including mangroves," he said in a statement earlier this week.
