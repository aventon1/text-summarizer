(AP) -- Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as  jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard to death.
(AP) -- The strategy for the first defendant on  trial in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard is clear: blame the co-defendant.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney  brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs said.
