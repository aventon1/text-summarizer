``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil suit in the case.
But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage.
``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're  police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said.
