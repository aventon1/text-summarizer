MBC TV reported last week that the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, secretly recorded a conversation between Hong _ then publisher of the mass-circulation newspaper JoongAng Ilbo _ and Lee Hak-soo, a high-ranking official with the Samsung Group, South Korea's largest business conglomerate.
Kim "never received any report of such illegal activities" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement.
Last month, television network MBC said it had acquired a spy agency recording of a 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung Group, the country's biggest industrial conglomerate.
