Snorre A, a steel tension-leg platform, was shut down Nov. 28 after a gas leak that resulted in the evacuation of 180 workers.
The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
"Statoil thinks it will be acceptable to resume partial production from its Snorre A platform in the North Sea," the company said in a statement, adding that, "a partial start-up could take place independently of remaining work with the platform wells".
