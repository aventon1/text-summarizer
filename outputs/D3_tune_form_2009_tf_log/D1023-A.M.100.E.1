*Wednesday, Feb. 24, 1999  	   	More Avalanches in Austria    	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche brought new  heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
Places like Davos, Switzerland, where the high and mighty of the worlds of government, industry and finance congregated at a conference early this month, are now inaccessible by road or rail, and others, like the fashionable Austrian resorts of Lech and Zuers, another 60 miles west of here, have been cut off for more than a week.
