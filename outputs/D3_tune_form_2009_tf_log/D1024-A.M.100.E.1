``We, as Sudanese, are ready to receive a specialized committee from the American administration to come and freely investigate whether this factory ... has anything to do with chemical (weapons),'' Ismail said.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
In his four-page letter, Roric denied that bin Laden owns the pharmaceutical factory and described accusations that the factory produces chemical weapons as ``untrue,'' adding ``the United States government does not have evidence.''
American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996.
