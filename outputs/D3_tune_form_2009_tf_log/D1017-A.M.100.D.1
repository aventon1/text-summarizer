``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
The prospect of an extremely powerful, coast-hugging hurricane ``was a scenario that ever since I've been here I've hoped I'd never see,'' Witt said Monday, noting that the destruction could cover ``not just one area, it's the whole coastline and the pounding it's going to take.''
``We did consider driving to Atlanta,'' said Bettye Cox, who lives in Boca Raton.
As if the threat of this hurricane was not enough bad news for Florida, another potentially dangerous storm, Hurricane Gert, seems to be taking roughly the same path as Floyd, just a few days behind.
