WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has rejected a motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
Attorneys Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke have asked that prospective jurors for the November 12 trial in Sacramento, California, be picked from within the Eastern District, which includes Sacramento and 22 other counties, according to news reports.
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
