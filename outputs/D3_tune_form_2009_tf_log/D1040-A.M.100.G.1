In his closing, defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach was likely to continue the line he took during trial, attacking the credibility of the two key witnesses:   _ Gary McLarty, a former "Baretta" stuntman and admitted cocaine user, said Blake offered him $10,000 and "insinuated" that he wanted Bakley dead.
Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the lawyer said.
"End this nightmare for Mr. Blake," he said, "and you will give him back his life."
