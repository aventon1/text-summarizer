The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.
That was the last contact.
I saw about 80 dead bodies, some were children," he said.
Experts were also looking into what might have happened in the last minutes of the plane which was declared "renegade" when it entered Greek air space and failed to make radio contact, causing two F-16 air force jets planes to scramble to investigate.
