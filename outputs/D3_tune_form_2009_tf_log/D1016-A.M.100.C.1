Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
Soeharto, in a speech on the channel controlled by his eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana on Sunday, said: "The fact is, I don't have even one cent of savings abroad, don't have accounts at foreign banks... let alone hundreds of billion of dollars."
JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Monday said he would ask former President Soeharto to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.
