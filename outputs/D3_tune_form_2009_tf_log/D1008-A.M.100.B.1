Monday's annual meeting, at a conference center on the grounds of Mount Vernon, Va., provided a chance for officials from Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assess the bay's health.
In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C., and several states vowed that the Chesapeake Bay would be cleaned up within 10 years.
It was touted as ``America's premier watershed restoration partnership,'' supported by the Environmental Protection Agency and representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.   Thirteen years before, the same entities had pledged to reduce the pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus in the bay by 40 percent.
