Brad E. Kodesh, president of the A1skateboards.com Web site, which sells skateboard equipment, said he did not think the law was necessary, because "ultimately, I think, wearing a helmet is the rider's decision; it should be enforced by the parents."
Kodesh, 25, said he uses a helmet and kneepads only when he goes to a special skate park, and said he has suffered, "some broken bones but no major injuries, thank goodness."
Jerry Smith, coach of the Santa Clara women's team, which received free headgear from Full90, said the equipment made his players more confident in challenging balls in the air, and more assertive, but not overly so.
