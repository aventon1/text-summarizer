Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
Because strict preventive measures have been taken for a long period, Zhao said, there has been no bird flu epidemic in recent years among Shenzhen's 168 chicken runs and 38 pigeon farms.
Inspections are under way to prevent a bird flu outbreak, such as random screening of chickens and checks on all poultry farms, said Yu, who is on a fact-finding tour in Shenzhen.
