Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed away from the funeral, but hundreds of women, breaking with Islamic tradition, joined in the march.
Later, at her home, Hariri's wife, Nazik, met President Jacques Chirac of France, a close friend of the ex-prime minister, who had come to pay his condolences.
