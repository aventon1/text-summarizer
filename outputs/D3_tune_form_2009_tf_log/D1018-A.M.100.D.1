Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.
Judge Bob Wit, who was sent in from the neighboring Dutch island of Curacao, extended the detention of Joran van der Sloot, 17, and brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, for eight days, said Mariaine Croes, who is not related to the fourth detainee.
On Friday, a judge ruled on a petition from the elder van der Sloot to visit his son, whom he has not been allowed to see since Joran was detained on June 9, and from the Kalpoes' attorneys requesting to see any evidence prosecutors may have gathered, Croes said.
