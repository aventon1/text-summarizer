After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was "a fair resolution of this case."
"To try to use (media interest) to make it more difficult for the victims' family to go through this process made sense from a tactical standpoint," said Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore, noting that Lafave attended many hearings in the case, ensuring cameras would capture her every move.
"In years past, generally, defense lawyers would have little or no comment (on high-profile cases)," Fitzgibbons said.
"What the victim's family said, was every time this came up the boy would get harassed at school," he said.
"Why is she the sex teacher?"
