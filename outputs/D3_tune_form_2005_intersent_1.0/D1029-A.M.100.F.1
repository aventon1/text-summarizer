Gunbattles between the renegade clansmen and troops from Pakistan's Frontier Corps continued throughout the day after the attack in Baluchistan province, corps chief Major General Shujjat Zamir Dar told reporters.
A ceasefire was agreed late Thursday to remove the dead and wounded.
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov.
During the 1970s the government brutally put down a major nationalist uprising in Baluchistan, leading to long-lasting distrust and resentment on both sides.
