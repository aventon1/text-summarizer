Separately, a bomb exploded in the toilet of a train elsewhere in restive Baluchistan province on Friday, killing one person and wounding five others, two critically, police said.
It follows a series of small explosions targeting Baluchistan's railways in the past two months and blamed on ethnic Baluch nationalists.
Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
