South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in the 1997 presidential election.
In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.
