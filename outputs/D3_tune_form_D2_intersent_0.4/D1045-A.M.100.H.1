The Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident as a result of an explosion on Nov. 13 at a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province, where the river originates.
The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
China and Russia have both pledged to cooperate closely to handle the pollution of the Songhua River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao here Thursday.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
