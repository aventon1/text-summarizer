Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located.
Only around 1,600 pandas are believed to live in the wild, with some 300 of the sub-species living in the Qinling mountains, while the other 1,300 giant pandas live elsewhere in China, Xinhua said in a separate report.
Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats.
More than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, with Sichuan home to 76 percent of them, according to the State Forestry Administration.
