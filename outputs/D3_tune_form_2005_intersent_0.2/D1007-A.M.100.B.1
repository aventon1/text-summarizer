HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious "bird flu" that has killed two people.
Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
They should tell doctors of their contacts with birds.
