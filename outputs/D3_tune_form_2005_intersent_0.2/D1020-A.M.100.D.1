HONG KONG (AP) _ Two batches of Heinz baby food have been recalled in Hong Kong following a similar action in the United States over worries they may contain high levels of lead, the Health Department said Monday.
The meat was under test by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
An estimated  1,100 people in the United States become seriously ill each year from eating food contaminated with Listeria.
