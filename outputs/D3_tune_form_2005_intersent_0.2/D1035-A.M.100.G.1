The birth defects, cancers and other illnesses that the Vietnamese attribute to Agent Orange can be caused by a wide range of factors, and Agent Orange may not be prominent among them.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Veterans Administration must review all  benefit claims denied to hundreds of Vietnam veterans who failed to say their illnesses resulted from exposure to Agent Orange, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
A 1989 court ruling in the case voided all VA benefit decisions  it had made based on the agency's assertion that only the skin disease chloracne was linked to Agent Orange.
Then they had children.
