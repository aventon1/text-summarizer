For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters.
On Tilghman Island, Harrison's Chesapeake House serves fried oyster sandwiches next to the bay (www.chesapeakehouse.com, 410-886-2121, 21551 Chesapeake House Drive).
As a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the algae and other particles in the bay, the menhaden ``ecologically speaking, (is) the most important animal'' in the bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation says.
Before the meeting, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation led a rally in which speakers accused government officials of dragging their feet on bay cleanup measures.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale.
