A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
The cause for the crash is yet to be known.
The other was not visible at all.
Fueling the relatives' anger were reports that the plane may have crashed due to a technical fault that had affected Helios planes in the past.
The worst airline crash in Greek history is also one of the most mysterious.
It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
