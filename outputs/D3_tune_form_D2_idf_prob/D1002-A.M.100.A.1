Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo had a gun.
Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether the officers waive their right to a jury trial.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
Diallo was hit 19 times.
