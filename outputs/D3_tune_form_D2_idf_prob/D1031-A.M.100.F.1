Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish.
According to the survey report, the country's mangrove forests have to date dwindled to 155,290 hectares, a 50 percent drop from 1980.
The reduction was blamed for the conversion of these forests to aquaculture and farming, which has seriously ruined the mangrove forests' ecosystem and impacted the sea environment.
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where river deltas provide lots of sediment.
At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.
The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of mangroves left in the world.
