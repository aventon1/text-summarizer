The Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident as a result of an explosion on Nov. 13 at a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province, where the river originates.
Quality of the river water is under close observation for 24 hours every day.
The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
It has compelled cities along the river to suspend water taking from the river for various periods.
