Bears also have died after being shot by hunters claiming self-defense or saying they mistook a grizzly for a black bear.
''In some ways I see hunting of grizzly bears in the future as positive tool,`` said Kim Barber, the U.S. Forest Service's grizzly bear and wolf coordinator for the Rocky Mountain region.
The bears still need intensive care.''
Only 200 or 250 grizzlies were in that region in 1975, when grizzly bears in the lower 48 states were listed under the Endangered Species Act.
Federal grizzly bear biologists in Montana say that years of research shows that the bear population around Yellowstone is robust and recovered.
