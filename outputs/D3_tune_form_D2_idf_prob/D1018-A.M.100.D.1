Players had to sign in, she said, and that gave them a name and initial: Joran V.   "After talking to enough people, we were able to deduce that it was Joran van der Sloot," she said.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again Sunday for questioning and was released.
Authorities have not released the results of the search, but Attorney General Caren Janssen has said that Paul van der Sloot is not under investigation.
