"A poisoning without the poison is like a murder without a gun," Zimpfer said.
But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades.
Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to their effects.
The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
