But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September, not suggestive of dioxin.
"There is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by poisoning of dioxin," said Michael Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
