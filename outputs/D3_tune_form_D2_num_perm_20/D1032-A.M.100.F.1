The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
On November 28, the company shut down Snorre A after a gas leak was detected.
"The situation is still serious," Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for the Norwegian oil group Statoil which operates the Snorre A offshore platform, told AFP.
