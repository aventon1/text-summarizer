Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat.
About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
New England's frogs and salamanders depend on vernal pools, shallow ponds that dry up each summer, to lay their eggs free from the threat of hungry fish.
"There may be an issue with frogs, that they are not warm and fuzzy," she said.
