Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
"This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's Stephanie Hanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted.
A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
Scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens, which erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years with a minor explosion, said on Saturday that they were expecting a more powerful eruption within a day or so.
