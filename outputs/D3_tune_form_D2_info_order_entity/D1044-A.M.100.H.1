Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
