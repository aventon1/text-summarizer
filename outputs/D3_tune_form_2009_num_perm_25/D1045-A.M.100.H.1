Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
The Nov. 13 blast in Jilin, a city in Jilin province, caused massive amounts of benzene, a toxic, flammable liquid to flow into the Songhua River.
The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
"It is the chemical plant of the CNPC in Jilin province."
