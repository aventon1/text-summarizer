Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
Lynndie England testified Monday as she pleaded guilty to seven abuse-related charges.
``I knew it was wrong,'' she said.
Referring to Graner, England repeatedly answered: ``He asked me to.''
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
