Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
"Mr. Van Der Sloot!"
Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is training to be a judge in Aruba.
