Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
Baluchistan has been in the grip of a sporadic tribal revolt for more han a year but the violence surged after the January 2 rape of a 32-year-old doctor in her lodgings near the Sui gasfield.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight.
The tribesmen have reportedly set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti.
