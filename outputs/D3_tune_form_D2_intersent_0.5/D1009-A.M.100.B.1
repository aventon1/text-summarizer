What has changed?
The Ramseys have denied any involvement.
A few hours after the dinner, White and Ramsey were searching the basement of the Ramsey house when Ramsey emerged from a room with his daughter's battered body.
The Ramseys have said their son was asleep in bed when Mrs. Ramsey found the note and called 911.
The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hear from neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well as many members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey.
The Ramseys have proclaimed their innocence.
