KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir launched a diplomatic offensive Friday to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital.
Sudan said it produced pharmaceutical products.
Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
The pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.
American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996.
