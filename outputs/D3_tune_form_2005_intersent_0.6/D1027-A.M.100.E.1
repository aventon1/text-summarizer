Shepard died following a brutal beating near Laramie in October  that police said was motivated in part because he was gay.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
Both could get the death penalty.
(AP) -- Seven people were dismissed Thursday as  jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
