Lynndie England testified Monday as she pleaded guilty to seven abuse-related charges.
Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
Lynndie R. England, the woman seen holding an Iraqi prisoner on a leash in the iconic photo from the Abu Ghraib prison, pleaded guilty Monday to seven charges stemming from prisoner abuse.
England, from West Virginia, was one of seven members of the Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company charged with humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib.
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
