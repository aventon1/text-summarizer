Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves.
In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown  of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, still thrives.
Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts from the popular students at Columbine.
