Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
"The government wants to kill us.
"This is true that some 17 Hindus were killed and their temple was severely damaged," Lasi said.
No arrests had been made, he said.
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui, which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation.
