LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School  students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.
Since the massacre, the suburban school has become a sealed  crime scene.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves.
