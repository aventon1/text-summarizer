New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
It is not," Howard said.
Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan.
"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture," he said.
"We need to work together to promote conservation."
Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "scientific research whaling".
