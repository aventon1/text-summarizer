Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.
