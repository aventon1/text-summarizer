Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
Police officers in criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case, fearing that juries would be unsympathetic.
Diallo's father would only say, ``I'm very happy.''
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
