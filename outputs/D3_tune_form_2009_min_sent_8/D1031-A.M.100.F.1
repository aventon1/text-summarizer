Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish.
The reduction was blamed for the conversion of these forests to aquaculture and farming, which has seriously ruined the mangrove forests' ecosystem and impacted the sea environment.
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where river deltas provide lots of sediment.
At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.
"The advantage of mangroves is severalfold," Cripps said.
"This is likely to lead to further pressure on the coastal forests, including mangroves," he said in a statement earlier this week.
The program aims to involve fishermen's families in growing and preserving forests.
