Eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured in fierce desert gunbattles with tribal rebels in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, officials said Friday.
Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
They agreed to a cease-fire early Friday.
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight.
