But others say that while the lack of mangrove forests probably exacerbated the destruction, it's unlikely that they would have slowed the tsunami's enormous volume of water.
The reduction was blamed for the conversion of these forests to aquaculture and farming, which has seriously ruined the mangrove forests' ecosystem and impacted the sea environment.
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where river deltas provide lots of sediment.
At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.

"This is likely to lead to further pressure on the coastal forests, including mangroves," he said in a statement earlier this week.
