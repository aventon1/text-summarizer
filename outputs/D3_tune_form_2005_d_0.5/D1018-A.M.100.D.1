A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.
Still accompanied by police, the group went to a couple of places looking for van der Sloot before returning to the father's house and finding Joran van der Sloot there with one of the two Surinamese brothers who later were detained, she said.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
