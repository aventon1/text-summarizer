The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
