Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
"I am very fearful about the future of the whitebark pine."
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said he also supported taking bears off the list.
This plan doesn't do it.''
Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
