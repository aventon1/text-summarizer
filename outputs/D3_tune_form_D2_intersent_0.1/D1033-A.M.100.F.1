President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
However, the South Korean president did not mention the fate of the country's Ambassador to the United States Hong Seok-hyun, who was allegedly involved in the slush funds scandal, according to the spokesman.
In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.
