Japan says it will seek approval to expand its catch at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) opening on May 30 in South Korea.
New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
"We need to work together to promote conservation."
It has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
