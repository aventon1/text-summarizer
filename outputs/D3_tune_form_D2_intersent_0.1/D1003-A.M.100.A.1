Only around 1,600 pandas are believed to live in the wild, with some 300 of the sub-species living in the Qinling mountains, while the other 1,300 giant pandas live elsewhere in China, Xinhua said in a separate report.
"She isn't out of danger," Li said.
Nature preserve workers in northwest China's Gansu Province have formulated a rescue plan to save giant pandas from food shortage caused by arrow bamboo flowering.
More than 100 giant pandas live there.
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
