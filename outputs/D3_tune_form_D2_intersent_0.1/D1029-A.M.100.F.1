Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov.
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast.
