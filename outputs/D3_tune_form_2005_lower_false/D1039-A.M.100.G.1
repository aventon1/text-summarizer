Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen announced that a memorial gathering for Van Gogh would be held Tuesday at 8:00 pm in Amsterdam's central Dam square, with two minutes of silence to be observed in Van Gogh's memory.
Van Gogh, 47, a distant relative of the 19th century painter Vincent van Gogh, had received death threats after the broadcast of the short TV film, "Submission."
He called Van Gogh "a champion of the freedom of speech" and lamented the polarization of Dutch society.
The film by Van Gogh, 47, the great-grandson of painter Vincent Van Gogh's brother, was aired in August on Dutch television, drawing the ire of some Muslims.
