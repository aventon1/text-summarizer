Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.
To accommodate the 1,965 Columbine students, the school day is  being split with Chatfield students beginning early in the day and Columbine students showing up shortly before 1 p.m.   	To prepare for the resumption of classes, some of Columbine's  158 teachers met Tuesday morning for the first time since two student gunmen fatally shot 12 fellow students and a teacher before taking their own lives.
