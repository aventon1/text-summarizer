New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
A statement by Labor foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd said Friday's court ruling "has confirmed the Howard governments spineless and hypocritical response to the slaughter of whales in the Australian Whale Sanctuary".
It has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
