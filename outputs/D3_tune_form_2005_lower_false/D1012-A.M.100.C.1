A Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by a private jetliner Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, with 115 passengers including 48 children and six crew members on board, Greek news media reported.
Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways quoted by Athens News Agency.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
It was unclear whether they were passengers or pilots.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
Crash scene investigators wearing surgical masks said most bodies appeared to be intact with some badly burnt.
