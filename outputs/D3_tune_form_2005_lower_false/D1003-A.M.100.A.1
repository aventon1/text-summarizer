Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located.
The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province will be completed this year, the China Daily said.
The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas.
Giant pandas, said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs, are cited as a "national gem" of China.
Giant pandas also continue to face threats from humans such as poaching, mining and logging, the report said.
