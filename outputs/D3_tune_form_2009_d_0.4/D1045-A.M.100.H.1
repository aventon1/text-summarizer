The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
It has compelled cities along the river to suspend water taking from the river for various periods.
Harbin, a city of more than 3 million residents, stops drawing water from the Songhua River for four days starting Wednesday.
