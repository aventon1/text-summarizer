Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
When Pohl asked about the photograph showing England holding a detainee by a leash, she said it was Graner's idea: ``I assumed it was OK, because he was an MP.
``But I did what they wanted me to.''
