The Songhua River is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian far east and China.
A major chemical explosion at Jilin Petrochemical Company 380 kilometers up the Songhua river on November 13 had sent massive amounts of benzene into the waterway.
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
"It is the chemical plant of the CNPC in Jilin province."
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
