Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its business dealings.
Two committees have been formed by the public to investigate the Soeharto clan's wealth.
Soedjono admitted Thursday that he had met lawyers representing Soeharto.
Meanwhile, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung Monday reiterated the government's seriousness in investigating Soeharto's wealth.
"The government is serious in investigating Soeharto's personal fortune.
He said the special team tasked to investigate the former president has already scheduled a meeting with Soeharto.
"Yes, Soeharto will receive the team soon," Tanjung said.
The decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
