HONG KONG (AP) _ Two batches of Heinz baby food have been recalled in Hong Kong following a similar action in the United States over worries they may contain high levels of lead, the Health Department said Monday.
A statement said 14,000 jars of 4-ounce (110 gram) Vegetable Chicken Dinner and 2.5-ounce (70 gram) Beginner Strained Carrots were being recalled by the distributor in the territory.
No illnesses have been reported.
The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
