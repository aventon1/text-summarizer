Armed men blocked a six-vehicle corps convoy containing 40 personnel that was moving towards the nearby gasfield town of Sui and opened fire.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui.
Tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region.
