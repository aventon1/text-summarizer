The birth defects, cancers and other illnesses that the Vietnamese attribute to Agent Orange can be caused by a wide range of factors, and Agent Orange may not be prominent among them.
In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996,  six other diseases were listed with ``limited or suggestive evidence of association'' to Agent Orange, other herbicides or the contaminant dioxin.
Evidence of diabetes' link to use of herbicides or dioxin is  listed by the study as still ``inadequate or insufficient'' to draw an association with Agent Orange or other chemicals used in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971.
