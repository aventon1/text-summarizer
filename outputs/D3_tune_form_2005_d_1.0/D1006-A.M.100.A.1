That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrex and Bextra, which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but are not identical to it.
The trial whose results pulled Vioxx off the market was designed to check how well 25 mg of Vioxx did in preventing recurrence of polyps in the colon.
Although that study's findings did not cause Vioxx to be withdrawn, Miller and Lopez-Mendez said the results put Vioxx lower on their list for prescribing.
Merck, which knew Vioxx was in competition with similar drugs, then conducted further trials, largely to find out if Vioxx could be legitimately recommended for other conditions.
