Last week a British toxicologist, Dr. John Henry, suggested that Yushchenko's symptoms were consistent with dioxin poisoning, which causes a severe form of acne called chloracne.
But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to their effects.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
