JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Monday said he would ask former President Soeharto to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.
