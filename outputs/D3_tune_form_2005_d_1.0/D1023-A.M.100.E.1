ROME _ An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.
Maj. Thomas Schoenherr of the Austrian army, told Austrian radio on Tuesday evening that about 55 people were feared missing in Galtuer.
Six remained missing, Austrian state radio said.
Just hours earlier, Austrian soldiers had taken advantage of a break in heavy snowfall to search for victims of yesterday's avalanche in the Alpine town -- relieving villagers who dug with bare hands to reach the missing.
