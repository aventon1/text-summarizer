Dioxin, a waste product of various industrial chemical processes, is a highly toxic chemical that remains in the body for years after exposure, so doctors were able to test their patient Friday, long after the near-fatal poisoning occurred.
Dioxin causes a strong predisposition toward developing cancer later in life and can also affect the body's fat metabolism.
``The aim was to kill me.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
Dioxin is a byproduct of industrial processes such as waste incineration and chemical and pesticide manufacturing.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
