Sudan said it produced pharmaceutical products.
Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated for injuries, including four in critical condition.
Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six Tomahawk missiles.
The pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.
Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest the attack.
American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum in 1996.
