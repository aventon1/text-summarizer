KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Six masked assailants have taken more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday.
The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast, eastern Malaysia.
Sipadan island is a popular resort especially for scuba-divers.
A waitress from the Philippines who escaped the abduction added weight to the Muslim rebels' claim that they were involved.
Five people were being questioned in connection with the abduction, Sabah chief of police Mamat Talib said.
Malaysia is very safe for tourists.''
