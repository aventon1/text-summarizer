The cause for the crash is yet to be known.
Among the passengers on the flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways quoted by Athens News Agency.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
Suspicions of a technical fault as the cause of the crash grew through the day as several of the callers said that they had experienced severe air conditioning problems when flying similar Helios jets in recent months.
The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials said.
How that did not happen (with the Helios flight) is extremely strange.''
