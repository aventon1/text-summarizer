Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
Diallo was hit 19 times.
