But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September, not suggestive of dioxin.
The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said.
``It is possible that we only found the dioxin,'' he said.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
His head has not been found.
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
