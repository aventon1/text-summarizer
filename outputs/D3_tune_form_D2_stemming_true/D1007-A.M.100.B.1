No bird flu case has been found in Macao and people should stay calm, experts from the Macao Nurses' Association and the Public Health Department said.
The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
