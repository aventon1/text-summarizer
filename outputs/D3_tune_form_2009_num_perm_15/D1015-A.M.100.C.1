Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest.
Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China.
Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites.
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
HAIKOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
