Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui.
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight.
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast.
He did not elaborate.
No arrests had been made, he said.
