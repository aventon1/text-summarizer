In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
