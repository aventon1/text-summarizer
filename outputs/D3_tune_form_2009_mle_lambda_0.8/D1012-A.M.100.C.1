A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
The cause of the crash, which killed all the 121 people aboard, was unclear, but it was apparently a technical problem, official sources said.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
Most of the passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
I saw about 80 dead bodies, some were children," he said.
"There is wreckage everywhere," Grammatiko Mayor George Papageorgiou said.
