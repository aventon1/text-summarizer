Hong has offered to resign the ambassadorship.
"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping," National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to reporters.
In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
