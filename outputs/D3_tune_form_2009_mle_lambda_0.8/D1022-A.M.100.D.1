Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing "to put whale meat on the table in Japan."

It is not," Howard said.
Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan.

It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese news reports said.
"We need to work together to promote conservation."
