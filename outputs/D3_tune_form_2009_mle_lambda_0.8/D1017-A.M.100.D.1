Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph.
``We are going to feel it,'' he said.
``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said.
Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm.
``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said.
Instead, she just bought hurricane supplies.
``It's beautiful,'' said Penalver.
It was moving west near 20 mph.
For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
