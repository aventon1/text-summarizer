But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," McClellan said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
"There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," said Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment."
Yushchenko repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his political rivals.
"I was deeply disappointed in this man," he told reporters.
