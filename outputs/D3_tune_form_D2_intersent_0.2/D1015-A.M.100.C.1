Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest.
Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China.
KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
