But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
"There is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by poisoning of dioxin," said Michael Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment.
``And I asked him about it.
The effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
