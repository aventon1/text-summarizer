Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph.
``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said.
Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
