Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.
Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600 pounds.
State and federal agencies will monitor the bears and their habitat and responsibility for managing bears will be turned over to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.
Only 200 or 250 grizzlies were in that region in 1975, when grizzly bears in the lower 48 states were listed under the Endangered Species Act.
This plan doesn't do it.''
