A Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by a private jetliner Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, with 115 passengers including 48 children and six crew members on board, Greek news media reported.
The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
How that did not happen (with the Helios flight) is extremely strange.''
