Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Britain's food safety watchdog Thursday added another 146 products to a list of items tainted by a potentially cancer-causing dye in the country's largest food recall yet.
The list of recalled foods includes dressings used by McDonald's fast food chain, packets of potato chips and pre-prepared meals.
