(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in  the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
``Matt was a person.
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school  dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him, leaving him lashed to a fence.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  convicted.
