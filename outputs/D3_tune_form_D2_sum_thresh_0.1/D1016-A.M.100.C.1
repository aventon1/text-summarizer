JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its business dealings.
He refused to disclose the details, saying that the investigation needs a long time.
"The government is serious in investigating Soeharto's personal fortune.
A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has been found in several provinces including land, factories and others.
