Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
Jonathan Crisp, said last week that England would enter a guilty plea at the pretrial hearing Monday on seven counts and then face sentencing by a military jury.
"The detainee was on the ground," England said.
When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap, England replied: "He wanted it to look more degrading with a female of my size."
