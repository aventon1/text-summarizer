Earlier in the day, Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
When I first met Rafik nearly 20 years ago, he had been spending the war years outside his native Lebanon, making friends and a fortune in Saudi Arabia.
The success of those winds will not come from the outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and women like Rafik Hariri.
