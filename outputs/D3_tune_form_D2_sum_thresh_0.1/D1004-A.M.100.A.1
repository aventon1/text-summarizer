PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast, crushing villages and leaving hundreds missing, officials said Sunday.
Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people.
Other air force transport planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if requested by the Papua New Guinean government.
Australian government aid agency Ausaid officers in Papua New Guinea estimated the final death toll would climb to more than 1,000, with many thousands injured, Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said.
The beaches are clean,'' Cassey said.
