KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
The letter was from Sudan's foreign minister, Erwa said.
Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated for injuries, including four in critical condition.
The attack in Khartoum and the simultaneous strike on Bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan were a ``totally unwarranted act of aggression,'' al-Sahhaf said.
Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
