South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Hong has offered to resign the ambassadorship.
"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping," National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to reporters.
In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president Kim Dae-Jung was in office.
