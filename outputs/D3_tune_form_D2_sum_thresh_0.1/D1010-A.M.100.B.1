It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease, especially tissue close to the animal's nervous system.
Canada, whose exports of beef products are effected by a single case of mad cow disease since may 2003, has exceeded its mad cow testing target for 2004, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported Sunday.
