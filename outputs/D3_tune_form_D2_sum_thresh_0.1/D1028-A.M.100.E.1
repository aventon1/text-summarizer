Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year.
He is charged with a third death in New Jersey.
Burrell said the length of the trial, which is expected to last up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the trial to another city.
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
