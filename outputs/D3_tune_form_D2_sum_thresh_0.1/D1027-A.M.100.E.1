McKinney's trial is set for Aug. 9.
Shepard died following a brutal beating near Laramie in October  that police said was motivated in part because he was gay.
(AP) -- In the weeks after the beating death of gay  student Matthew Shepard, this college town found itself portrayed as backwards, homophobic, an outpost of Wild West-style violence and small-mindedness.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  convicted.
