The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the  islands, meteorologists said.
MIAMI (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd neared the strength of a  Category 5 storm today and headed west, thousands of coastal residents were ordered to evacuate and NASA began moving workers out of the low-lying Kennedy Space Center.
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
As if the threat of this hurricane was not enough bad news for Florida, another potentially dangerous storm, Hurricane Gert, seems to be taking roughly the same path as Floyd, just a few days behind.
