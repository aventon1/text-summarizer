But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
``There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning,'' he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic.
``It is possible that we only found the dioxin,'' he said.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
``The aim was to kill me.''
``We hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' Yuschenko said.
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," McClellan said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
