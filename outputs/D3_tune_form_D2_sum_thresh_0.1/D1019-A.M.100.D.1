KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- James and Mary Murphy were just another American couple escaping on a dream vacation to a lush Malaysian resort island.
''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad told Philippine radio station DXRZ.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
Malaysia is very safe for tourists.''
