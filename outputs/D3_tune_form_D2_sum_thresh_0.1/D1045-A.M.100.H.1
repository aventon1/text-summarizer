"After the explosion at the Jilin Petrochemical Company under China National Petroleum Corporation, our observation showed pollutants containing benzene had flown into the Songhua River and caused water pollution," said an official with SEPA.
Zhang Lijun, deputy director general of SEPA said China would keep Russia informed at all times about the monitoring results of the polluted stretches of Songhua River.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
Zhang said as the polluted water flows downstream, the density of pollutants has markedly subsided.
