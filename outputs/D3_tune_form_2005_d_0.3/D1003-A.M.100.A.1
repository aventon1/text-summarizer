The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province will be completed this year, the China Daily said.
The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas.
They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the region over recent years.
In Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, two other habitats of giant pandas, arrow bamboo was also found blooming.
