Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
The list of recalled foods includes dressings used by McDonald's fast food chain, packets of potato chips and pre-prepared meals.
