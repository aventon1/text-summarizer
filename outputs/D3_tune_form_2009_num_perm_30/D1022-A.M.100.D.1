New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing "to put whale meat on the table in Japan."
"We need to work together to promote conservation."
"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture," he said.
It has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
