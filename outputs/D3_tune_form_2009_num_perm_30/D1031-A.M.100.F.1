At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where river deltas provide lots of sediment.
"This is likely to lead to further pressure on the coastal forests, including mangroves," he said in a statement earlier this week.
Governor Ram Kapse told reporters.
The reduction was blamed for the conversion of these forests to aquaculture and farming, which has seriously ruined the mangrove forests' ecosystem and impacted the sea environment.
According to the survey report, the country's mangrove forests have to date dwindled to 155,290 hectares, a 50 percent drop from 1980.
