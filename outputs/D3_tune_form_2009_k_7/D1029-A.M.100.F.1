Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight.
On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
No arrests had been made, he said.
