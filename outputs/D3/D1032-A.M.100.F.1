"Gas is no longer appearing on the sea surface," said Terje Overvik,
executive vice president for Statoil's exploration and production
Norway, adding that work was still ongoing to permanently secure the
well.
"We still have a fair amount of work to do before we can resume
production," Oivind Reinertsen, a senior Statoil official, said in
the statement.
Statoil pumped cement into the production well to permanently cap it
and prevent any further leaks.
"A startup depends in part on maintaining our schedule for the
remaining work," said Oivind Reinertsen, Statoil's senior vice
president for the Tampen cluster of fields, which includes Snorre.
