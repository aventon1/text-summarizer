Among the passengers on the 
flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways 
quoted by Athens News Agency.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus,
to Athens International Airport.
The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials
said.
How that did not happen (with the Helios
flight) is extremely strange.''
The dead included 48 Greek Cypriot children and youths on a holiday
school trip to Prague, a spokesman for Helios said.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
Crash scene investigators wearing surgical masks said most bodies appeared to be
intact with some badly burnt.
