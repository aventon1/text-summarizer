Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from
the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see
the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
Diallo remained silent during the whole encounter, they said.
Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.
The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand  
jury.
The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a
second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe
``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was
shot after he had fallen.
Diallo was hit 19 times.
