The killer tsunami that was touched off by an 8.7-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra island on Dec. 26, has climbed to over 145,000 so far, with over 90,000 deaths reported in Indonesia.
Indonesia's official earthquake and tsunami death toll rose by more than 100 people Wednesday to 94,200, the health ministry said.
At least 95,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Indonesia.
The Chinese team arrived in Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, at 05:10 a.m. local time by a chartered plane.
A Chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged Indonesia early Friday to help emergency aid efforts there.
