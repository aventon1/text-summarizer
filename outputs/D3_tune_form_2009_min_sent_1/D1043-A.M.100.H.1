Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
The Lebanese interior minister said on Tuesday that initial indications showed that former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a suicide car bombing.
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.

His death matters.
