JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
When pressed if they would be defending the former president, Soedjono evasively retorted: ``They are conducting their job in accordance with their code of ethics to defend truth and justice''.
Ghalib came under fire after he said on Monday that he believed Soeharto's public denial of charges that he had accumulated a fortune worth billions of U.S. dollars during his rule.
The decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
