"If they (the Bugti tribesmen) make any move, if they open fire or attack, the government will give full response," he said.
"The government wants to kill us.
"There is a strong possibility that the attack could be a reaction to the situation in Dera Bugti, because of the violence there," Baluchistan police chief Chaudhry Muhammad Yaqub told AFP.
On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
