There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
As for the reasons, I know nothing.
Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," the spokesman said after doctors at the clinic confirmed for the first time that Yushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin.
