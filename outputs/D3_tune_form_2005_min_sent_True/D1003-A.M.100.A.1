They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the region over recent years.
Zhang said that 22 giant pandas living in the Bikou and Rangshuihe areas, where much of the bamboo is blooming, are currently under the threat of starvation.
The nature preserve, occupying about 220,000 hectares, has 102 giant pandas living wild.
Giant pandas also continue to face threats from humans such as poaching, mining and logging, the report said.
