Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and other groups say that too many threats still exist for the bears.
