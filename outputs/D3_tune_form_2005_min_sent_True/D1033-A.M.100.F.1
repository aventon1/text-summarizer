South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun on Monday ordered the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to thoroughly investigate the allegation that one of the nation's biggest conglomerates provided huge slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case, his spokesman Kim Man-Soo said.
Civic groups have urged state prosecutors to investigate Lee, Hong and the Samsung chief.
Prosecutors on Friday began questioning Lee Sang-ho, the MBC reporter who obtained the tape, said Sun Dong-kyu, the network's editor in charge of political coverage.
