"When a person has an eating disorder, it becomes a family problem," Hecht says.
While the reasons for adult eating disorders vary widely, a majority of sufferers, if not previously anorexic or bulimic, have dealt with weight issues at some point in their lives, says Alger-Mayer.
Anorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million to 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
"We traditionally think of anorexia and bulimia affecting those of college or high school age, but I found that they were also affecting two groups of middle-aged women as well."
