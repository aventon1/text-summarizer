She warned jurors to beware of ``red herrings'' put up by the defense, including McLarty's mental breakdown three years after Bakley's killing, Hambleton's earlier legal woes, the dearth of forensic evidence and a book author who shadowed homicide detectives during the investigation of Bakley's murder.
But Blake's lawyer, pointing out that no blood, DNA or other evidence directly links Blake to the 2001 slaying of Bonny Lee Bakley, said prosecutors were relying on a drug-using liar as a key witness and a bungled police investigation,   "They convicted Mr. Blake on the night of the murder and then they conducted an incompetent investigation," defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach said.
