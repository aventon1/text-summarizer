"We have stopped production" at Snorre A, Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for Statoil, told AFP.
No injuries were reported.
But it will take some time before these efforts will be completed," the company said.
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
