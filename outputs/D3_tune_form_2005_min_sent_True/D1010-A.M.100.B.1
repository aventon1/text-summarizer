Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.
Department of Health officials said Friday that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S. beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow disease late last year.
Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food Sanitation, noted that although there was only a single case of mad cow disease found in the United States, the actual situation in the United States has to be evaluated.
