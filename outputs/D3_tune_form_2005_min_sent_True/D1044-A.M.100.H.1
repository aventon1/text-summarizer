The advice came after Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA) last week issued a warning that some 350 food products may be affected and should be withdrawn from the shelves.
Britain's food safety watchdog Thursday added another 146 products to a list of items tainted by a potentially cancer-causing dye in the country's largest food recall yet.
The total number of affected goods, ranging from ready-made-meals to popular sauces, came to 474 after a previous list of some 430 items issued by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) was found to have a number of duplications, it said.
