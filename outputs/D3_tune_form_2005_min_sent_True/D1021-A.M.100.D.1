Lafave, 25, pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery, a felony, in exchange for a sentence of three years of community control and seven years of probation.
As part of the agreement, Lafave will also plead guilty to three sex charges in Marion County, including one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition.
After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was "a fair resolution of this case."
Did race play a factor in prosecutors' decision to charge him, and/or the judge's choice of sentence?
"In years past, generally, defense lawyers would have little or no comment (on high-profile cases)," Fitzgibbons said.
