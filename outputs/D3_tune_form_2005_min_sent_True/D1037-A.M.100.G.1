There's no oysters.
The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a nonnative -- and, they hope, disease-resistant -- species to the bay.
In the 1970s and '80s, before diseases started their rampant spread through the bay, the average harvest reported to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources was more than 2 million bushels.
The bay needs oysters.
``We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions about,'' said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.
About 90 percent of Maryland's crab meat is produced by plants using H-2B workers, said Douglas Lipton, a professor of resource management at the University of Maryland.
