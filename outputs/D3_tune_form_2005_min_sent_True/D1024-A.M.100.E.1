UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan will ask the Security Council to consider authorizing a U.N. investigation into the U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum factory, Sudan's ambassador said Friday, calling the attack a breach of international law.
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
