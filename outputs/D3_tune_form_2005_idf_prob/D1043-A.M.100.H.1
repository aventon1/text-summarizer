"Assad condemned the horrible terrorist act that claimed lives of a number of Lebanese people, notably former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri," SANA said.
"Syria as a government and people announces support to sisterly Lebanon during those dangerous situations and offers condolences to Mr. Rafik Hariri and other victims' families," Assad was quoted as saying.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.
At least 14 others were killed.
