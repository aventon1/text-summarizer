The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
The EU said the program was one of 82 programs tackling 10 major animal diseases, including rabies, mad cow, and scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease found in sheep.
According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on 85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
