``There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning,'' he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic.
Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades.
Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to their effects.
``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
