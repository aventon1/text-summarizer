To avoid tsunami, people should neither reside in the areas close to coastlines nor destroy mangrove forests that protect tidal waves, he said from the agency's compound in Bandung, West Java.
The reduction was blamed for the conversion of these forests to aquaculture and farming, which has seriously ruined the mangrove forests' ecosystem and impacted the sea environment.
"Mangroves contribute directly to rural livelihoods by providing wood and non-wood forest products _ including timber, poles, fuel wood and thatch for houses," said Mette Loyche Wilkie, an agency expert, "and indirectly by providing spawning grounds and nutrients for fish and shellfish."
