A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
Shouting "murderers," and "You deserve lynching," the crowd demanded to know whether their relatives were actually on board the Helios Airways flight ZU522 that left Larnaca for Athens International Airport when it crashed at about 12:20 p.m. (0920GMT) near Grammatiko, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Greek capital.
It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
