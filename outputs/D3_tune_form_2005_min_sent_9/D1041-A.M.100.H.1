More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs, a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years.
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
For example, according to a report issued this month by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what conditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.
